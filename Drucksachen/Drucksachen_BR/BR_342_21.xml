Stellungnahme der Bundesregierung zu dem Vorschlag f&#252;r eine 
Verordnung des Europ&#228;ischen Parlaments und des Rates &#252;ber 
die Bewertung von Gesundheitstechnologien und zur &#196;nderung 
der Richtlinie 2011/24/EU
Bundesministerium  Berlin, 20. April 2021 
f&#252;r Gesundheit 
Parlamentarische Staatssekret&#228;rin
An den 
Pr&#228;sidenten des Bundesrates 
Herrn Ministerpr&#228;sidenten 
Dr. Reiner Haseloff 
Sehr geehrter Herr Bundesratspr&#228;sident,
die Europ&#228;ische Kommission hat am 31. Januar 2018 einen Vorschlag f&#252;r eine
Verordnung des Europ&#228;ischen Parlaments und des Rates &#252;ber die Bewertung von
Gesundheitstechnologien und zur &#196;nderung der Richtlinie 2011/24/EU vorgelegt 
(Health Technology Assessment - HTA; KOM (2018) 51, endg.; Ratsdok. 5844/18). 
Gerne m&#246;chte ich Sie und die Mitglieder des Bundesrates mit diesem Schreiben &#252;ber 
den aktuellen Sachstand zu diesem Dossier unterrichten.
Basierend auf Artikel 114 des Vertrages &#252;ber die Arbeitsweise der Europ&#228;ischen 
Union (AEUV) sah der Vorschlag der Europ&#228;ischen Kommission eine vollst&#228;ndige 
Harmonisierung von HTA auf der Ebene klinischer Bewertungen f&#252;r alle neuen
Arzneimittel, die dem zentralen Zulassungsverfahren unterliegen, und bestimmte
Medizinprodukte vor. Die Mitarbeit an den gemeinsamen klinischen Bewertungen sowie
siehe Drucksache 34/18 (Beschluss)
die anschlie&#223;ende Verwendung der Berichte als Grundlage f&#252;r nationale
Entscheidungen &#252;ber Preisbildung und Erstattung sollten verpflichtend sein. Die
Mitgliedstaaten sollten in den genannten Bereichen keine eigenen Bewertungen durchf&#252;hren
d&#252;rfen.
Mit Beschluss vom 20. M&#228;rz 2018 hat der Deutsche Bundestag nach Artikel 6 des
Protokolls Nummer 2 zum Vertrag von Lissabon erkl&#228;rt, dass der HTA-
Verordnungsvorschlag nach seiner Auffassung die Einhaltung des
Subsidiarit&#228;tsgrundsatzes verletzt und Bedenken zur Vereinbarkeit mit dem Grundsatz der
Verh&#228;ltnism&#228;&#223;igkeit bestehen (BT-Drs. 19/1296). Der Vorschlag griff in der damaligen
Ausgestaltung - insbesondere mit Blick auf die verpflichtende Verwendung der gemeinsamen 
klinischen Bewertungen durch die Mitgliedstaaten und dem Verbot eigene
Bewertungen durchzuf&#252;hren - in die rechtlich gesch&#252;tzte Zust&#228;ndigkeit der Mitgliedstaaten f&#252;r 
die Festlegung ihrer Gesundheitspolitik sowie f&#252;r die Organisation des
Gesundheitswesens und medizinischen Versorgung nach Artikel 168 Absatz 7 AEUV ein. Zudem
besseres Funktionieren des Binnenmarktes durch den Abbau administrativer H&#252;rden 
f&#252;r Hersteller von Gesundheitstechnologien nicht auch durch angemessenere Mittel 
erreicht werden k&#246;nne. Auch Frankreich (Senat) und die Tschechische Republik
(Abgeordnetenkammer) hatten eine Subsidiarit&#228;tsr&#252;ge ausgesprochen. Der Deutsche
Bundesrat hat mit seiner Stellungnahme vom 27. April 2018 vergleichbare Bedenken zum 
Ausdruck gebracht (BR-Drs. 34/18), so auch das Parlament in Polen.
Nach &#252;ber zwei Jahren mit schwierigen und kleinteiligen Verhandlungen, hat
Deutschland unter seiner EU-Ratspr&#228;sidentschaft im zweiten Halbjahr 2020 erstmals einen 
Gesamttext als Kompromissvorschlag vorgelegt, der insgesamt eine weitgehende
Zustimmung fand. Dennoch konnten die Verhandlungen auf Ratsebene, aufgrund der 
Herausforderung der COVID-19-Pandemie, nicht mehr unter deutscher
Ratspr&#228;sidentschaft zum Abschluss gebracht werden. Es freut mich daher, Ihnen zu berichten, dass 
es der portugiesischen Ratspr&#228;sidentschaft auf Grundlage des deutschen
Kompromissvorschlags gelungen ist, am 24. M&#228;rz 2021 vom Ausschuss der St&#228;ndigen Vertreter der 
Regierungen der Mitgliedstaaten der Europ&#228;ischen Union mit qualifizierter Mehrheit 
ein Mandat zur Aufnahme von Verhandlungen mit dem Europ&#228;ischen Parlament zu 
erhalten (Ratsdokument 7310/21). 
Das Mandat wurde auf der Grundlage von Ratsdokument 7310/21 (vgl. Anlage) erteilt, 
das wesentliche deutsche Anliegen aufgreift und die folgenden Eckpunkte enth&#228;lt:
&#61623; doppelte Rechtsgrundlage: Artikel 114 und 168 AEUV; 
&#61623; ausdr&#252;ckliche Klarstellung, dass die ausschlie&#223;liche Zust&#228;ndigkeit der  
Mitgliedstaaten f&#252;r die Preisbildung und Erstattung von Arzneimitteln und 
Medizinprodukten nicht ber&#252;hrt wird; 
&#61623; zun&#228;chst eingeschr&#228;nkter Anwendungsbereich, der dann schrittweise
erweitert wird (Start mit Onkologika); M&#246;glichkeit Produkte flexibel
einzubeziehen, wenn diese das Potential haben einen ungedeckten medizinischen
Bedarf zu decken oder Notf&#228;lle im Bereich der &#246;ffentlichen Gesundheit zu
adressieren; flexibler Auswahlmechanismus f&#252;r die Bewertung von
Medizinprodukten nach bestimmten Kriterien (ungedeckter medizinischer Bedarf; 
Potential f&#252;r Patientinnen und Patienten etc.); 
&#61623; die gemeinsamen wissenschaftlichen Bewertungen erfassen die
Anforderungen aller Mitgliedstaaten und d&#252;rfen keine Werturteile oder 
Schlussfolgerungen &#252;ber den Zusatznutzen eines Produktes enthalten; 
&#61623; die gemeinsamen wissenschaftlichen Bewertungen haben f&#252;r die
Mitgliedstaaten keinen rechtsverbindlichen Charakter und sollen allein in den
nationalen HTA-Verfahren ber&#252;cksichtigt werden;
&#61623; kein Verbot, erg&#228;nzende nationale Bewertungen durchzuf&#252;hren; 
&#61623; verbindlicher Mechanismus zur Einreichung der f&#252;r die gemeinsamen
Bewertungen erforderlichen Informationen und Daten auf EU-Ebene: Daten 
und Informationen die von Herstellern bereits auf EU-Ebene eingereicht 
wurden, d&#252;rfen nicht erneut auf nationaler Ebene angefordert und
eingereicht werden;
&#61623; rein verfahrensrechtliche Rolle f&#252;r die Europ&#228;ische Kommission; 
&#61623; h&#246;chst m&#246;gliche Transparenz &#252;ber die eingereichten Daten und Information 
und Austausch &#252;ber nationale HTA-Bewertungen.
Offen bleibt allein die Frage der allgemeinen Mehrheitsanforderungen.1
W&#228;hrend sich die kleineren Mitgliedstaaten f&#252;r eine 2/3-Mehrheit ohne
Stimmgewichtung aussprachen, traten Deutschland und weitere gro&#223;e Mitgliedstaaten 
f&#252;r eine qualifizierte Mehrheit mit Stimmgewichtung ein. Dieser sehr politische
1 Deshalb handelt es sich um eine partielle allgemeine Ausrichtung des Europ&#228;ischen Rates.
Punkt muss nunmehr in den Verhandlungen mit dem Europ&#228;ischen Parlament 
gekl&#228;rt werden, welches ebenfalls eine qualifizierte Mehrheit fordert (vgl.
Ab&#228;nderung 203, EP-Dokument P8_TA-PROV(2018)0369).
Insgesamt gew&#228;hrleistet der vorliegende Text, dass die Mitgliedstaaten ihre 
HTA-Expertise auf europ&#228;ischer Ebene b&#252;ndeln und damit allen
Mitgliedstaaten eine solide wissenschaftliche Grundlage f&#252;r informierte Preis - und
Erstattungsentscheidungen im Kontext ihres spezifischen nationalen
Gesundheitssystems zur Verf&#252;gung steht. Zugleich bleibt die ausschlie&#223;liche nationale
Zust&#228;ndigkeit f&#252;r die Entscheidung &#252;ber Preisbildung- und Erstattung von
Arzneimitteln und Medizinprodukten unber&#252;hrt. Durch den verbindlichen
Mechanismus zur Einreichung der f&#252;r die gemeinsamen Bewertungen erforderlichen 
Informationen und Daten auf EU-Ebene, wird zudem der finanzielle und
administrative Aufwand f&#252;r Hersteller von Gesundheitstechnologien reduziert, 
der sich aus unterschiedlichen nationalen Datenanforderungen ergeben kann. 
Durch den Abbau administrativer H&#252;rden wird ein Beitrag zur Vermeidung 
von Doppelarbeit und zum besseren Funktionieren des Binnenmarktes
geleistet.
Die Bundesregierung wird die Verhandlungen mit dem Europ&#228;ischen Parlament 
genau verfolgen. Voraussetzung f&#252;r eine deutsche Zustimmung bleibt
insbesondere, dass die gemeinsamen wissenschaftlichen Bewertungen f&#252;r die
Mitgliedstaaten keine Werturteile &#252;ber den Zusatznutzen eines Produktes enthalten und 
sie keinen rechtsverbindlichen Charakter bekommen. Die Verantwortung der 
Mitgliedstaaten f&#252;r die Gesundheitsversorgung ihrer B&#252;rgerinnen und B&#252;rger 
muss durch einen Abstimmungsmechanismus mit qualifizierter Mehrheit zum 
Ausdruck kommen.

Draft text for a 
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
on health technology assessment and amending Directive 2011/24/EU 
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular 
Articles 114 and 168 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, 
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee, 
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions, 
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,
Whereas: 
(1) The development of health technologies is a key driver of economic growth and innovation in
the Union. It forms part of an overall market for healthcare expenditure that accounts for 10%
of EU gross domestic product. Health technologies encompass medicinal products, medical
devices, in vitro diagnostic medical devices and medical procedures, as well as measures for
disease prevention, diagnosis or treatment.
(2) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is an evidence-based process that allows competent
authorities to determine the relative effectiveness of new or existing technologies. HTA
focuses specifically on the added value of a health technology in comparison with other new
or existing health technologies.
(3) HTA can cover both clinical and non-clinical aspects of a health technology, depending on the
healthcare system. The EU co-funded joint actions on HTA (EUnetHTA Joint Actions) have
identified nine domains by reference to which health technologies are assessed. Of these nine
domains, four are clinical and five are non-clinical. The four clinical domains of assessment
concern the identification of a health problem and current technology, the examination of the
technical characteristics of the technology under assessment, its relative safety, and its relative
clinical effectiveness. The five non-clinical assessment domains concern cost and economic
evaluation of a technology, its ethical, organisational, social, and legal aspects.
(4) The outcome of HTA is used to inform decisions concerning the allocation of budgetary
resources in the field of health, for example in relation to establishing the pricing or
reimbursement levels of health technologies. HTA can therefore assist Member States in
creating and maintaining sustainable healthcare systems and to stimulate innovation that
delivers better outcomes for patients.
(5) The carrying out of parallel assessments by multiple Member States and divergences between
national laws, regulations and administrative provisions on the processes and methodologies
of assessment can result in health technology developers being confronted with multiple and
divergent requests for data. It can also lead to both duplications and variations in outcomes,
which is justified by the specific national health care context.
(6) While Member States have carried out some joint assessments within the framework of the
EU co-funded joint actions, the voluntary cooperation and production of output has been
inefficient, relying on project-based cooperation in the absence of a sustainable model of
cooperation. Use of the results of the joint actions, including their joint clinical assessments,
at Member State level has remained low, meaning that the duplication of assessments on the
same health technology by HTA authorities and bodies in different Member States within
identical or similar timeframes has not been sufficiently addressed.
(7) The Council in its Conclusions of December 20141 acknowledged the key role of health
technology assessment and called on the Commission to continue to support cooperation in a
sustainable manner.
(8) The European Parliament, in its resolution of 2 March 20172, called on the Commission to
propose legislation on a European system for health technology assessment as soon as
possible and to harmonise transparent health technology assessment criteria in order to assess
the added therapeutic value of medicines.
(9) In its 2015 Communication on upgrading the single market3, the Commission declared its
intention to introduce an initiative on HTA to increase coordination in order to avoid multiple
assessments of a product in different Member States and improve the functioning of the
Single Market for health technologies.
(10) This Regulation aims to achieve a high level of protection of health for patients and users
while ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market as regards medicinal products, in
vitro diagnostic medical devices and medical devices. At the same time, this Regulation
establishes a framework to support Member States cooperation and the measures needed for
clinical assessment of health technologies. Both objectives are being pursued simultaneously
and are inseparably linked whilst one not being secondary to the other. As regards Article 114
of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), this Regulation sets the
procedures and the rules for carrying out joint work and establishing a framework at Union
level. As regards Article 168 TFEU, whilst aiming at providing a high level of health
protection, this Regulation allows for the cooperation between Member States on certain
aspects of HTA.
1 OJ C 438, 6.12.2014, p. 12
2 European Parliament resolution of 2 March 2017 on EU options for improving access to medicines &#8211;
2016/2057(INI)

(11) Health technology developers often face the difficulty of submitting the same information,
data, analyses and other evidence to different Member States, and also at various points in
time. The duplication of submissions and consideration of different timings for submission
across Member States may constitute a significant administrative burden for health
technology developers, in particular for smaller companies with limited resources, and might
contribute to an impeded and distorted market access, leading to a lack of business
predictability, higher costs, and, in the long run, to negative effects on innovation. Thus, this
Regulation should provide for a mechanism that ensures that any information, data, analyses
and other evidence required for the joint clinical assessment should be submitted only once at
Union level by the health technology developer.
(12) In accordance with Article 168(7) TFEU, the Member States are responsible for the definition
of their health policies and for the organisation and delivery of their health services and
medical care. These responsibilities of the Member States include the management of health
services and medical care and especially the allocation of the resources assigned to them.
Therefore, it is necessary that Union action is limited to those aspects of HTA that relate to
the joint clinical assessment of a health technology, and to ensure in particular that there are
no value judgements in joint clinical assessments in order to sustain the responsibilities of
Member States pursuant to Article 168(7) TFEU. The outcome of joint clinical assessments
should therefore neither affect the discretion of Member States to carry out assessments on the
added clinical value of the technologies concerned nor predetermine subsequent decisions on
pricing and reimbursement of health technologies, including the fixing of criteria for such
pricing and reimbursement decisions, which may depend on both clinical and non-clinical
considerations individually, or together, and which remain solely a matter of national
competence.
(13) Member States should be able to perform complementary clinical analyses, which are
necessary for their overall national health technology assessment process, on the health
technologies for which a joint clinical assessment report is available. In particular, Member
States should be able to perform complementary clinical analyses relating, inter alia, to
patient groups, comparators or outcomes other than those included in the joint clinical
assessment report, or using a different methodology if that methodology would be required in
the overall national health technology assessment process of the Member State concerned.
Should additional information, data, analyses and other evidence be needed for
complementary assessment, Member States should be able to ask the health technology
developers to submit this necessary information, data, analyses and other evidence. This
Regulation should not restrict in any way Member States' rights to perform non-clinical
assessments on the same health technology prior to, during the preparation of, or after the
publication of a joint clinical assessment report.
(14) In order to guarantee the highest quality of joint clinical assessments, ensure a wide
acceptance and enable pooling of expertise and resources across national HTA bodies, it is
appropriate to follow a stepwise approach, starting with a small number of jointly assessed
medicinal products and only at a later stage and, after careful review, require joint clinical
assessments to be carried out for all medicinal products undergoing the centralised marketing
authorisation procedure provided for under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European
Parliament and of the Council4, which incorporate a new active substance, and where those
medicinal products are subsequently authorised for a new therapeutic indication.
4 Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down 
Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary 
use and establishing a European Medicines Agency (OJ L 136, 30.4.2004, p. 1)
(15) Joint clinical assessments should also be carried out on certain medical devices within the
meaning of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council5 which
are in the highest risk classes and for which the relevant expert panels have provided their
opinions or views, as well as on in vitro diagnostic medical devices classified as class D
pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/7466.
(16) Taking into consideration the complexity of certain medical devices and in vitro diagnostic
medical devices, and the expertise required to assess them, Member States should be able,
where they see an added-value, to undertake voluntary cooperation on HTA on medical
devices classified as class IIb and III pursuant to Article 51 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and
in vitro diagnostic medical devices classified as class D pursuant to Article 47 of Regulation
(EU) 2017/746 which are software and do not fall within the scope of joint clinical
assessments under this Regulation.
(17) In order to ensure that joint clinical assessments carried out on health technologies remain
accurate and relevant, it is appropriate to establish conditions for the updating of assessments,
in particular where additional data available subsequent to the initial assessment has the
potential to increase the accuracy of the assessment.
(18) A coordination group composed of Member States' representatives, in particular from health
technology assessment authorities and bodies, should be established with responsibility for
overseeing the carrying out of joint clinical assessments and other joint work.
(19) The Commission should neither take part in votes on joint clinical assessments nor comment
on the content of joint clinical assessment reports.
5 Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices, 
amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and 
repealing Council Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC (OJ L 117, 5.5.2017, p. 1) 
6 Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on in vitro 
diagnostic medical devices and repealing Directive 98/79/EC and Commission Decision 2010/227/EU (OJ L 
117, 5.5.2017, p. 176)
(20) The Coordination Group should ensure that the scientific joint work as well as the procedures
and methodology for the preparation of joint clinical assessment reports and joint scientific
consultation outcome documents guarantee the highest quality, are prepared in a timely
manner and reflect the state of the art of medical science at the time of their preparation.
(21) In order to ensure a Member State-led approach to joint clinical assessments and scientific
consultations, Member States should designate the members of the Coordination Group.
Those members should be designated with the goal to ensure a high level of competence in
the Coordination Group. Members of the Coordination Group should designate health
technology authorities and bodies to the subgroups, which provide adequate technical
expertise for carrying out joint clinical assessments and joint scientific consultations taking
into account the need to provide expertise on the HTA of medicinal products, medical devices
and in vitro diagnostic medical devices.
(22) The assessment scope for joint clinical assessments should be inclusive and should reflect all
Member States&#8217; requirements in terms of data and analyses to be submitted by the health
technology developer.
(23) When joint clinical assessments are used to prepare subsequent administrative decisions at
Member State level, they constitute one of several preparatory steps in a multi-step procedure.
Member States remain the sole entity responsible for national HTA processes, for the
conclusions on the value of a health technology and for the decisions resulting from the health
technology assessments. Member States may determine at which step of their health
technology assessment process, and by which authority or body, the joint clinical assessment
reports should be considered.
(24) Member States should remain responsible for drawing conclusions at national level on the
clinical added value of a health technology, as such conclusions depend on the specific
healthcare context in any given Member State, and on the relevance of individual analyses
included in the joint clinical assessment report (e.g. several comparators could be included in
the joint clinical assessment report, of which only a selection is relevant to a given Member
State). The joint clinical assessment report should include a description of the relative effects
observed for the health outcomes analysed, including numerical results and confidence
intervals, and an analysis of scientific uncertainty and strengths and limitations of the
evidence (e.g. internal and external validity). The joint clinical assessment report should be
factual and should not contain any value judgement, or ranking of outcomes, nor conclusions
on the overall benefit or added clinical value of the assessed health technology, nor any
position on the target population in which the technology should be used, nor any position on
the place the technology should have in the therapeutic, diagnostic or preventive strategy.
(25) Where Member States conduct HTA at national or regional level for health technologies that
have been assessed at Union level, they should consider the joint clinical assessment reports at
that level. In this regard, especially taking into account that different timing can apply for
national HTA decisions, Member States should be able to take into account other information,
data, analyses and other evidence that were not part of the joint clinical assessment at EU
level.
(26) In the context of this Regulation, the term &#8220;give due consideration&#8221;, when applied to a joint
clinical assessment report, means that the report should be part of the documentation of bodies
or organisations involved in HTA activities at Member State or regional level and should be
considered for any health technology assessment at Member State level. If the joint clinical
assessment report is available, it should be part of the documentation that supports the
national HTA process. However, the content of the report, scientific in nature, should not be
binding on those bodies, organisations or on Member States. If a joint clinical assessment
report is not available at the time when the national HTA is finalised, this should not delay
any subsequent process at Member State level. A joint clinical assessment report should have
purely internal administrative effect for any health technology assessment at Member State
level and no external impact for applicants and other parties other than the Member States.
(27) The obligation on Member States not to request at national level any information, data,
analyses and other evidence which has been submitted by health technology developers at
Union level reduces, where health technology developers comply with information
submission requirements stipulated pursuant to this Regulation, the administrative and
financial burden for them resulting from being confronted with multiple and divergent
requests for information, data, analyses and other evidence at Member State level. This
obligation should however not exclude the possibility for Member States to ask for
clarification to health technology developers about the submitted information, data, analyses
and other evidence.
(28) The obligation on Member States not to request at national level the same information, data,
analyses and other evidence that has been already submitted by health technology developers
at Union level should not encompass requests of information, data, analyses and other
evidence within the scope of early access programmes at Member State level. Such early
access programmes at Member State level are aimed at providing patient access in situations
of high unmet medical needs before a centralised marketing authorisation has been granted.
(29) Health technology developers should not submit any information, data, analyses and other
evidence at national level that has been already submitted at Union level. This guarantees that
Member States can only request information, data, analyses and other evidence from health
technology developers at Member State level that are not already available at Union level.
(30) For medicinal products, randomised blinded controlled directly comparative studies, the
methodology of which conforms to international standards of evidence-based medicine,
should be preferentially considered when conducting a joint clinical assessment. This should
however not per se exclude observational studies, including those based on real world data,
when such studies are accessible.
(31) The timeframe for joint clinical assessments for medicinal products should be fixed, as far as
possible, by reference to the timeframe applicable to the completion of the centralised
marketing authorisation procedure provided for under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. Such
coordination should ensure that clinical assessments could effectively facilitate market access
and contribute to the timely availability of innovative technologies for patients. Health
technology developers should therefore respect the deadlines established pursuant to this
Regulation when submitting the requested information, data, analyses and other evidence.
(32) The establishment of a timeframe for the joint clinical assessments for medical devices and in
vitro diagnostic medical devices should take into account the highly decentralised market
access pathway for these products and the availability of appropriate evidence data required to
carry out a joint clinical assessment. As the required evidence may only become available
after the medical device or the in vitro diagnostic medical device has been placed on the
market, and in order to allow for the selection of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic
medical devices for joint clinical assessment at an appropriate time, it should be possible for
assessments of such devices to take place following their placing on the market.
(33) In all cases, the joint work carried out under this Regulation, in particular the joint clinical
assessments, should aim to produce high-quality and timely results, and not delay or interfere
with the CE marking of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical device or the market
access of health technologies. This work should be separate and distinct from the regulatory
assessments of the safety, quality, efficacy and performance of health technologies carried out
pursuant to other Union legislation and should have no impact on decisions taken in
accordance with other Union legislation.
(34) In order to facilitate the process of preparing joint clinical assessments, health technology
developers should, in appropriate cases, be afforded the opportunity to engage in joint
scientific consultations with the Coordination Group in order to obtain guidance on the
information, data, analyses and other evidence that are likely to be required from clinical
studies. Clinical studies comprise clinical trials of medicinal products, clinical investigations
required for the clinical evaluation of medical devices and performance studies required for
performance evaluations of in vitro diagnostic medical devices. Given the preliminary nature
of the consultation, any guidance offered should not be legally binding either on the health
technology developers or on HTA authorities and bodies. Such guidance should, however,
reflect the state of the art of medical science at the time of the scientific consultation.
(35) Where joint scientific consultations are carried out in parallel with the preparation of scientific
advice on medicinal products provided for under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the
European Parliament and of the Council or in parallel with the consultation on medical
devices provided for in Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the
Council, those parallel processes, including information exchange between the subgroups and
the European Medicines Agency or the expert panel on medical devices, should be carried out
with a view to ensure that the evidence generation fulfils the needs of the respective
frameworks, while the remits should remain separate.
(36) Joint clinical assessments and joint scientific consultations necessitate the sharing of
confidential information between health technology developers and HTA authorities and
bodies. In order to ensure the protection of such information, information provided to the
Coordination Group in the framework of assessments and consultations should only be
disclosed to a third party after a confidentiality agreement has been concluded. In addition, it
is necessary that any information made public about the results of joint scientific consultations
is presented in an anonymised format with the removal of any information of a commercially
sensitive nature.
(37) In order to ensure the efficient use of available resources, it is appropriate to provide for a
"horizon scanning", to allow the early identification of emerging health technologies that are
likely to have a major impact on patients, public health and healthcare systems. Such horizon
scanning could be used to support the Coordination Group in planning its work, in particular
in relation to joint clinical assessments and joint scientific consultations, and could also
provide information for long term planning purposes at both Union and national levels.
(38) The Union should continue to support voluntary cooperation on HTA between Member States
in areas such as the development and implementation of vaccination programmes and
capacity building of national HTA systems. Such voluntary cooperation should also facilitate
synergies with initiatives under the digital single market strategy in relevant digital and
datadriven healthcare areas with a view to provide additional real world evidence relevant for
HTA.
(39) In order to ensure the inclusiveness and transparency of the joint work, the Coordination
Group should engage and consult widely with stakeholders. However, in order to preserve the
integrity of the joint work, rules should be developed in this Regulation to ensure the
independence and impartiality of patients, clinical and other experts involved.
(40) In order to ensure a uniform and Member State-driven approach to the joint work provided for
in this Regulation, the Coordination Group should develop its detailed procedural steps and
their timing for joint clinical assessments, updates of joint clinical assessments and joint
scientific consultations. Where appropriate, distinct rules should be developed for medicinal
products, medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices. When developing these
rules, the Coordination Group may take into account the results of the work undertaken in the
EUnetHTA Joint Actions.
(41) The Coordination Group should develop methodological guidance on the joint work provided
for in this Regulation, following international standards of evidence-based medicine, and
guidance on the appointment of assessors and co-assessors for joint clinical assessments and
joint scientific consultations, including on the scientific expertise required to implement the
joint work stipulated in this Regulation.
(42) In order to ensure a uniform approach to the joint work provided for in this Regulation,
implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to establish general procedural
rules for ensuring that health technology assessment authorities and bodies carry out joint
clinical assessments in an independent and transparent manner, free from conflicts of interest,
for the mechanisms concerning the interaction between health technology bodies and health
technology developers during joint clinical assessments, to establish the format and the
templates of submission and report documents and for the consultation of stakeholders. Where
appropriate, distinct rules should be developed for medicinal products, medical devices and in
vitro diagnostic medical devices. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with
Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council7, as referred to
in Article 30.
7 Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying 
down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the 
Commission's exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13)
(43) When preparing the implementing acts foreseen in this Regulation, it is of particular
importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory
work, including with the Coordination Group and at expert level, and that those consultations
be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement
of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making8.
(44) In order to ensure that sufficient resources are available for the joint work provided for under
this Regulation, the Union should provide funding for the joint work and voluntary
cooperation, and for the framework to support these activities. The funding should cover the
costs of producing joint clinical assessment and joint scientific consultation reports. Member
States should also have the possibility to second national experts to the Commission in order
to support the secretariat of the Coordination Group.
(45) In order to facilitate the joint work and the exchange of information between Member States
on HTA, provision should be made for the establishment of an IT platform that contains
appropriate databases and secure channels for communication. The Commission should
ensure a link between the IT platform and other data infrastructures relevant for the purposes
of HTA such as registries of real world data.
(46) In order to ensure the smooth establishment and operation of Union-level joint assessments,
as well as to safeguard their quality, it is appropriate to start with a small number of joint
assessments. After three years of the date of application of this Regulation, the Commission
should be empowered to adopt implementing acts stipulating a progressive expansion of the
number of joint clinical assessments carried out annually. The number of assessments to be
carried out should be determined with due consideration of the resources of Member States
participating and thus, prior to the adoption of such implementing acts, the Commission
should gather all necessary expertise and in particular consult the Coordination Group in order
to ensure a manageable workload.
8 Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the 
European Commission of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1)
(47) In order to ensure that the support framework continues to be as efficient and cost-effective as
possible, the Commission should report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the
implementation of this Regulation no later than three years after its application. The report
should focus on reviewing the added value of the joint work for Member States. The report
may in particular consider whether there is a need to introduce a fee-paying mechanism,
which would ensure the independence of the Coordination Group, through which health
technology developers would also contribute to the financing of joint scientific consultations.
In addition, the report should review the effect of the non-duplication of the request of
information, data, analyses and other evidence for joint clinical assessment in terms of
reducing administrative burden for Member States and health technology developers,
facilitating market access for new and innovative products and reducing costs.
(48) Member States should no later than two years after the beginning of assessing medicinal
products that fall under the scope of this Regulation report to the Commission on the
application of this Regulation and, in particular, on their assessment of the added value of the
joint clinical assessment reports in their national health technology assessment processes and
the workload of the Coordination Group.
(49) In order to adjust the list of information to be submitted by health technology developers, the
power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the
Commission in view of amending Annex I and Annex II. It is of particular importance that the
Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at
expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid
down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In
particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European
Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts,
and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing
with the preparation of delegated acts.
(50) Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council9 provides that the Union
is to support and facilitate the cooperation and the exchange of scientific information among
Member States within a voluntary network connecting national authorities or bodies
responsible for health technology assessment designated by the Member States. As those
matters are governed by this Regulation, Directive 2011/24/EU should be amended
accordingly.
(51) The objectives of this Regulation, namely to establish a framework of joint clinical
assessments of certain health technologies at Union level, can only be sufficiently achieved by
cooperation of the Member States at Union-level. The Union may adopt measures, in
accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TFEU. In accordance with
the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond
what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.

outcome document.
5. Notwithstanding paragraph 4, where the necessary specific expertise is otherwise not
available, the same assessor and/or co-assessor involved in the joint scientific consultation
may be appointed to conduct the joint clinical assessment. Such appointment shall be justified
and subject to approval of the Coordination Group and shall be documented in the joint
clinical assessment report.
6. The designated sub-group shall initiate a scoping process in which it identifies the relevant
parameters for the assessment scope. The assessment scope shall be inclusive and reflect
Member States&#8217; needs in terms of parameters and of the information, data, analysis and other
evidence to be submitted by the health technology developer. It shall identify in particular all
the relevant parameters for the assessment in terms of:
(a) the patient population;
(b) the intervention or interventions;
(c) the comparator or comparators;
(d) the health outcomes.
The scoping process shall also take into account input received from patients, clinical and 
other relevant experts. 
7. The Coordination Group shall inform the Commission of the assessment scope of the joint
clinical assessment.
Article 6a 
The Joint Clinical Assessment Reports and the dossier of the health technology developer 
1. A joint clinical assessment shall result in a joint clinical assessment report that shall be
accompanied by a summary report (hereinafter "the reports"). The reports shall not contain
any value judgement or conclusions on the overall clinical added value of the assessed health
technology and shall be limited to a description of the scientific analysis:
(a) of the relative effects of the health technology as assessed on the health outcomes
against the chosen parameters based on the assessment scope as set out pursuant to
Article 6;
(b) of the degree of certainty of the relative effects taking into account the strengths and
limitations of the available evidence.
2. The reports shall be based on a dossier of complete and up-to-date information, data, analyses
and other evidence submitted by the health technology developer to assess the parameters
identified in the scoping process.
2a. The dossier shall meet the following requirements:

request the submission of the dossier (first request). The submission request shall include the
deadline for submission as well as the dossier template pursuant to Article 23(1)(i). For
medicinal products, the deadline for submission shall be at the latest 45 days prior to the
envisaged date of the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use
adopted in accordance with Articles 6(3) and 14(9) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.
2. The health technology developer shall submit the dossier to the Commission in accordance
with the submission request pursuant to paragraph 1.
3. The health technology developer shall not submit any information, data, analyses or other
evidence at the national level that has been already submitted at Union level. This requirement
shall not affect requests for additional information on products that fall within the scope of
early access programmes at Member State level that aim to provide patient access in
situations of high unmet medical needs before a centralised marketing authorisation has been
granted.
4. Where the Commission confirms the timely submission of the dossier pursuant to paragraph 1
and that the dossier meets the formal requirements laid out in paragraphs 2 and 2a of Article
6a and Annex I or Annex II, the Commission shall make the dossier immediately available to
the members of the Coordination Group via the IT platform referred to in Article 27 and
inform the health technology developer thereof.
5. Where the Commission finds that the dossier fails to meet the formal requirements laid out in
paragraphs 2 and 2a of Article 6a and Annex I or Annex II, it shall request the missing
information, data, analyses and other evidence from the health technology developer (second
request), who shall submit the requested information, data, analyses and other evidence within
five working days from the receipt of the request.
6. Where the Commission deems that a dossier was not submitted in a timely manner by the
health technology developer, or attests that it fails to meet the formal requirements set out in
paragraphs 2 and 2a of Article 6a and Annex I or Annex II (after the second request), the
Coordination Group shall discontinue the joint clinical assessment. If the assessment is
discontinued, the Commission shall make a statement on the IT platform referred to in Article
27 justifying the reasons of the discontinuation and shall inform the health technology
developer accordingly. In case of discontinuation of the joint clinical assessment point (c) of
paragraph 1 of Article 8 shall not apply.
7. Where the joint clinical assessment has been discontinued and the Coordination Group,
pursuant to point (d) of Article 8(1), subsequently receives information, data, analyses and
other evidence that formed part of the original submission request in accordance with Article
6b(1) submitted by the health technology developer at Member State level, the Coordination
Group may re-initiate a joint clinical assessment in accordance with the procedure pursuant to
Article 6a at the latest six months after the submission deadline set in accordance with
paragraph 1, once the Commission has confirmed that formal requirements set out in
paragraphs 2 and 2a of Article 6a and Annex I or Annex II have been fulfilled.
7a. Without prejudice to paragraph 7, where a joint clinical assessment has been re-initiated, the 
Coordination Group may request the developer to submit updates of previously provided 
information, data, analyses and other evidence.
Article 6c 
Assessment Process for Joint Clinical assessments 
1. On the basis of the dossier submitted by the health technology developer and the assessment
scope as set pursuant to Article 6(6), the assessor, with the assistance of the co-assessor, shall
prepare the draft reports. The reports shall be endorsed by the Coordination Group according
to the timeline set pursuant to point (e) of paragraph 6 of Article 3. The end of that timeline
shall be:
(a) for medicinal products, no later than 30 days following the marketing authorisation
granted by the Commission;
(b) for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices, within a reasonable time
after the notified body has provided the health technology developer with a certificate,

required as part of a joint clinical assessment. The joint scientific consultation shall
encompass a face-to-face or virtual meeting with the health technology developer and result in
an outcome document that outlines the scientific recommendation. Joint scientific
consultations shall in particular concern all relevant clinical study, or clinical investigation
design aspects, including but not be limited to, comparators, interventions, health outcomes,
and patient populations. When providing joint scientific consultations on health technologies
other than medicinal products, the specificities of those health technologies shall be taken into
account.

States, on the Coordination Group or on health technology developers.
4. Where a Member State carries out a national scientific consultation on a health technology
that has been the subject of a joint scientific consultation, it shall inform the Coordination
Group thereof via the IT platform referred to in Article 27. Joint scientific consultations can
take place in parallel with the scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency pursuant
to Article 57(1)(n) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. Such parallel consultations imply the
exchange of information and synchronised timing, while the respective remits remain
separate. Joint scientific consultations on medical devices can take place in parallel with the
consultation of the expert panels pursuant to Article 61(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745.
