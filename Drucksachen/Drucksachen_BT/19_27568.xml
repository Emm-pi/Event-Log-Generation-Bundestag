Beschlussempfehlung
In Kenntnis des Entwurfs des EU-Jahresberichts &#252;ber Menschenrechte und
Demokratie in der Welt im Jahr 2019 auf Ratsdok. 8404/20
(&#220;berweisungsdrucksache 19/22367 A.68) wolle der Deutsche Bundestag folgende Entschlie&#223;ung
annehmen:
&#8222;Der Deutsche Bundestag wertet den EU-Jahresbericht des Jahres 2019 &#252;ber
Menschenrechte und Demokratie in der Welt als einen umfassenden &#220;berblick
&#252;ber die vielf&#228;ltigen internen und externen Aktivit&#228;ten der Europ&#228;ischen Union
(EU) im Bereich ihrer Menschenrechtspolitik. &#220;ber den Berichtszeitraum hinweg
hat die EU weltweit die Umsetzung ihrer Ziele innerhalb der letzten Phase des
Aktionsplans f&#252;r Menschenrechte und Demokratie (2015-2019) vorangetrieben. 
Die EU setzte sich auch im Jahr 2019, dem zehnten Jahr des Bestehens der Charta
der Grundrechte, nachdr&#252;cklich f&#252;r die F&#246;rderung und den Schutz der
Menschenrechte als Kernst&#252;ck des Multilateralismus ein. Aufgrund der weltweit zu
verzeichnenden erheblichen R&#252;ckschritte im Bereich Menschenrechte und
Demokratie war dieser Einsatz im Jahr 2019 erneut unverzichtbar. 
Im Dezember 2019 hat sich der Rat f&#252;r Ausw&#228;rtige Angelegenheiten auf die
Festlegung einer weltweiten Sanktionsregelung der EU im Bereich der
Menschenrechte verst&#228;ndigt, mit der weltweit auf schwere Menschenrechtsverletzungen
reagiert werden kann, unabh&#228;ngig davon, ob diese von staatlichen oder
nichtstaatlichen Akteuren begangen wurden. Unter deutscher Ratspr&#228;sidentschaft wurde
der Sanktionsmechanismus im darauf folgenden Jahr beschlossen, der
Einzelpersonen und Organisationen treffen kann, die f&#252;r schwere
Menschenrechtsverletzungen wie V&#246;lkermord, Verbrechen gegen die Menschlichkeit, Folter, Sklaverei, 
sexuelle und geschlechtsspezifische Gewalt, Entf&#252;hrungen von Menschen oder
Menschenhandel verantwortlich sind. Mit dem Globalen
Menschenrechtssanktionsregime (EUGHRSR) ist es nun m&#246;glich, den daf&#252;r verantwortlichen Personen
die Einreise in die EU zu verbieten und ihr Verm&#246;gen in der EU einzufrieren. Die
EU wird damit in die Lage versetzt, sich konkreter und direkter f&#252;r die
Menschenrechte einzusetzen - einen der Grundwerte der EU und ihrer Au&#223;enpolitik.
Die im Berichtszeitraum auf multilateraler Ebene fortgef&#252;hrten intensiven
Bem&#252;hung der EU f&#252;r die universelle F&#246;rderung und den Schutz der 
Menschenrechte in allen Gremien der Vereinten Nationen (VN), insbesondere
dem VN-Menschenrechtsrat, erkennt der Deutsche Bundestag ebenso wie die
enge Zusammenarbeit mit dem Hohen Kommissar der VN f&#252;r Menschenrechte
(OHCHR), dem Europarat und der Organisation f&#252;r Sicherheit und
Zusammenarbeit in Europa (OSZE) als wichtigen Beitrag an, f&#252;r die europ&#228;ischen
Werte mit Nachdruck einzutreten und sie weltweit einzufordern. Im Jahr 2019
fanden diese wichtigen Bem&#252;hungen in einem immer schwieriger werdenden
Kontext statt, der durch zahlreiche weltweit negative Tendenzen in den Bereichen
Menschenrechte, Demokratie und Rechtsstaatlichkeit gepr&#228;gt war.
Zu den EU-Instrumentarien im Bereich Menschenrechte z&#228;hlen neben den
Menschenrechtsleitlinien die L&#228;nderstrategien, die Menschenrechtsdialoge sowie das
Europ&#228;ische Instrument f&#252;r Demokratie und Menschenrechte (EIDHR). Ziel ist
es, die Gesamtheit der Instrumente der EU systematisch und koordiniert
einzusetzen. 
Zu den bestehenden Menschenrechtsleitlinien, die regelm&#228;&#223;ig aktualisiert werden
und den EU-Akteuren weltweit als praktischer Leitfaden bei der Umsetzung von
menschenrechtlichen Priorit&#228;ten der EU auf lokaler Ebene dienen, kamen im
Berichtszeitraum weitere hinzu. Der EU-Jahresbericht 2019 informiert, dass
erstmalig EU-Leitlinien mit einem Schwerpunkt auf wirtschaftlichen, sozialen und
kulturellen Rechten verabschiedet wurden. Dazu z&#228;hlen die EU-
Menschenrechtsleitlinien f&#252;r einwandfreies Trinkwasser und Sanit&#228;rversorgung. Diese Leitlinien
er&#246;ffneten neue Perspektiven daf&#252;r, der Untrennbarkeit b&#252;rgerlicher, politischer,
wirtschaftlicher, sozialer und kultureller Rechte Geltung zu verschaffen.
Leitlinien &#252;ber Nichtdiskriminierung im ausw&#228;rtigen Handeln wurden verabschiedet
sowie die Leitlinien f&#252;r die Politik der Europ&#228;ischen Union gegen&#252;ber
Drittl&#228;ndern betreffend Folter und andere grausame, unmenschliche oder erniedrigende
Behandlung oder Bestrafung &#252;berarbeitet.
Den 128 L&#228;nderstrategien, die im Zeitraum 2016 bis 2020 umgesetzt wurden,
misst der Deutsche Bundestag hohe Bedeutung bei, da auf der Grundlage von
politischer und operativer Analyse der Menschenrechtslage in einem Land wichtige 
strategische Priorit&#228;ten f&#252;r das Vorgehen der EU gesetzt sowie konkrete
Ma&#223;nahmen festgelegt werden, um Demokratie und Menschenrechte zu f&#246;rdern.
Rechtsstaatlichkeit ist die am h&#228;ufigsten genannte Priorit&#228;t, gefolgt von Frauenrechten
und Demokratie. 
Die EU f&#252;hrte im Berichtszeitraum 2019 bereits mit 39 Partnerl&#228;ndern und
regionalen Organisationen formelle Menschenrechtsdialoge und -konsultationen, um
Menschenrechtsverletzungen sowie spezifische Themen anzusprechen und auf
Verbesserungen hinzuwirken. Informelle Menschenrechtsdialoge mit den 
Golfstaaten wurden zu den wichtigen Themen Todesstrafe, Recht auf ein faires
Verfahren und das Recht auf Meinungsfreiheit gef&#252;hrt. Nachdr&#252;cklich setzte sich
die EU in diesen Dialogen f&#252;r die Abkehr des Kafala-Systems ein, das die
Besch&#228;ftigung von Wanderarbeitnehmern regelt und den Arbeitgebern in der
Vergangenheit eine umfassende Kontrolle &#252;ber ihre Besch&#228;ftigten gew&#228;hrt hat. Als
wesentlichen Erfolg erkennt der Deutsche Bundestag die daraufhin im Jahr 2020
neu erlassenen Gesetze Katars an, die sich positiv auf die Rechte ausl&#228;ndischer
Arbeitnehmer im Land auswirken.
Mit dem EIDHR besteht ein einzigartiges Finanzierungsinstrument f&#252;r die
F&#246;rderung und Unterst&#252;tzung der Demokratie und der Menschenrechte weltweit. Auch 
ohne das Einverst&#228;ndnis der Regierung eines betreffenden Landes kann es zum
Einsatz gebracht werden, um die direkte Zusammenarbeit mit isolierten und
marginalisierten Organisationen der Zivilgesellschaft zu erm&#246;glichen. Das EIDHR
leistet erhebliche Unterst&#252;tzung f&#252;r den Multilateralismus und die wichtigsten
Institutionen der internationalen Menschenrechtsarchitektur. Der Deutsche
Bundestag sch&#228;tzt das Engagement des EIDHR zur Unterst&#252;tzung der Demokratie, die
sich im Jahr 2019 durch sieben Wahlbeobachtungsmissionen und neun
Wahlexpertenmissionen konkretisierte. Das EIDHR unterst&#252;tzte weiterhin unter anderem
das OHCHR, den Internationalen Strafgerichtshof (IStGH) sowie regionale
Menschenrechtsmechanismen und -instrumente. Zudem f&#246;rderte es ein globales
Netzwerk von Universit&#228;ten mit Studiengang Menschenrechtsbildung gef&#246;rdert.
Im Februar 2019 wurde Eamon Gilmore als Sonderbeauftragter der EU f&#252;r
Menschenrechte ernannt, sein Mandat wurde vor kurzem verl&#228;ngert. Unter der Leitung 
des Hohen Vertreters/Vizepr&#228;sidenten (HR/VP) verfolgt der EU-
Sonderbeauftragte ein breit angelegtes, flexibles Mandat, das eine Anpassung an sich
wandelnde geopolitische Umst&#228;nde erm&#246;glicht. Er folgt auf Stavros Lambrinidis, der 
das Amt seit 2012 innehatte, und setzt sich f&#252;r die Umsetzung der
Menschenrechtspolitik der Union, die Einhaltung des humanit&#228;ren V&#246;lkerrechts und die
Achtung der internationalen Strafgerichtsbarkeit sowie die Umsetzung des
Ratsbeschlusses &#252;ber den IStGH ein, erh&#246;ht die politische Koh&#228;renz und verleiht
Europa durch den Dialog &#252;ber die Menschenrechte eine st&#228;rkere Stimme. Der
Deutsche Bundestag begr&#252;&#223;t ausdr&#252;cklich die Hervorhebung der wichtigen Priorit&#228;ten
w&#228;hrend der unter seinem Vorsitz durchgef&#252;hrten Menschenrechtsdialoge im
Berichtszeitraum. Diese umfassen die Bek&#228;mpfung der Folter, die Abschaffung der
Todesstrafe, den Schutz der Religions- und Weltanschauungsfreiheit, den Schutz
von Menschenrechtsverteidigern, die F&#246;rderung der Menschenrechte von Frauen,
M&#228;dchen und LGBTI-Personen, die Freiheit der Meinungs&#228;u&#223;erung, die Achtung
des humanit&#228;ren V&#246;lkerrechts sowie die Rechenschaftspflicht im Fall von
Menschenrechtsverletzungen und -verst&#246;&#223;en. 
Der Deutsche Bundestag best&#228;rkt den EU-Sonderbeauftragten in seinem
Engagement, zivilgesellschaftliche Organisationen direkt einzubeziehen. Denn dies ist
entscheidend daf&#252;r, dass die Dialoge ergebnisorientiert bleiben. Der EU-
Sonderbeauftragte arbeitet regelm&#228;&#223;ig auch im Vorfeld von Menschenrechtsdialogen mit
zivilgesellschaftlichen Organisationen zusammen. Es z&#228;hlt zu seinen Priorit&#228;ten,
die Rolle der Zivilgesellschaft zu sch&#252;tzen, in den Dialog mit lokalen und
regionalen Menschenrechtsakteuren zu treten und sie zur Weiterf&#252;hrung ihrer Arbeit
zu bef&#228;higen. 
Mit weiterhin gro&#223;er Sorge nimmt der Deutsche Bundestag zur Kenntnis, dass
auch im Berichtszeitraum immer mehr Staaten ihre Zivilgesellschaften,
insbesondere ihre Nichtregierungsorganisationen und Menschenrechtsverteidiger, in ihren
Wirkungsm&#246;glichkeiten u.a. durch restriktiver werdende Gesetzgebung
beschr&#228;nken. Die Mitglieder des Deutschen Bundestages begr&#252;&#223;en daher ausdr&#252;cklich die
im Jahr 2019 erfolgte kompromisslose Unterst&#252;tzung von
Menschenrechtsverteidigern durch die EU. Sie &#252;bte scharfe Kritik an Einschr&#228;nkungen des
Handlungsspielraums der Zivilgesellschaft und unterst&#252;tzte Menschenrechtsverteidiger, vor 
allem wenn sie gef&#228;hrdet waren, mit politischen und finanziellen Ma&#223;nahmen. 
Im Jahr 2019 brachte die EU im Rahmen politischer Dialoge mit Partnerl&#228;ndern,
darunter mehr als 20 Menschenrechtsdialoge und -konsultationen, wiederholt ihre
Besorgnis &#252;ber Verletzungen der Religions- und Weltanschauungsfreiheit zum
Ausdruck, insbesondere gegen&#252;ber L&#228;ndern des Nahen Ostens, Nordafrikas sowie
S&#252;d-, Zentral- und S&#252;dostasiens. In multilateralen Gremien trat die EU weiterhin
als starke Verfechterin dieses Menschenrechts auf. Auf ihre Initiative hin wurden
im VN-Menschenrechtsrat sowie im Dritten Ausschuss der VN-
Generalversammlung Resolutionen eingebracht, die Staaten auffordern, die Religions- und
Weltanschauungsfreiheit zu sch&#252;tzen, zu achten und zu verwirklichen und die
Besorgnis der EU &#252;ber Verletzungen der Religionsfreiheit zum Ausdruck bringen. Der
Deutsche Bundestag nimmt positiv und mit gro&#223;em Interesse das breite
Engagement der EU f&#252;r Religions- und Weltanschauungsfreiheit auf, das auch 2019 eine
wesentliche Priorit&#228;t der ausw&#228;rtigen Menschenrechtspolitik der EU darstellte, 
die den Leitlinien der EU zur F&#246;rderung und zum Schutz der Religions- und
Weltanschauungsfreiheit folgt. Vor diesem Hintergrund nimmt der Deutsche
Bundestag die bislang noch nicht erfolgte Nachbesetzung eines Sondergesandten f&#252;r die
F&#246;rderung von Religions- und Weltanschauungsfreiheit au&#223;erhalb der EU nach
dem Ausscheiden J&#225;n Figels im Jahr 2019 aus dem Amt mit Befremden zur
Kenntnis. Der Sonderbeauftragte richtete im letzten Jahr seiner Amtszeit sein
Bem&#252;hen mit Erfolg u.a. auf Initiativen im Bereich des interreligi&#246;sen Dialogs und
der Schaffung von Synergien zwischen der Religions- und
Weltanschauungsfreiheit und bildungspolitischen und kulturellen Aktivit&#228;ten.
Die EU setzte ihr menschenrechtliches Engagement f&#252;r die Abschaffung der
Todesstrafe, gegen Folter und Misshandlungen, f&#252;r Gleichstellung und
Nichtdiskriminierung, wirtschaftliche, soziale und kulturelle Rechte und ebenfalls im Bereich
Wirtschaft und Menschenrechte auch im Jahr 2019 fort.
Der Deutsche Bundestag begr&#252;&#223;t den Aufruf der EU an die Staaten und alle
Unternehmen, die Leitprinzipien der VN f&#252;r Wirtschaft und Menschenrechte und
deren drei S&#228;ulen &#8222;Verpflichtung des Staates zum Schutz&#8220;,
&#8222;Unternehmensverantwortung zum Respekt&#8220; und &#8222;Zugang zu Rechtsmitteln&#8220; umzusetzen und
einzuhalten. Bei der Ausarbeitung nationaler Aktionspl&#228;ne zur Umsetzung der
Leitprinzipien sind die Mitgliedsstaaten der EU weiterhin weltweit f&#252;hrend. Der
Deutsche Bundestag best&#228;rkt die EU darin, auch auf EU-Ebene einen umfassenden
Handlungsrahmen f&#252;r die koh&#228;rente Umsetzung der VN-Leitzprinzipien zu
erarbeiten und die unternehmerische Sorgfaltspflicht europaweit verbindlich zu
regeln.
&#220;ber diese Themen hinaus setzte die EU ihr Engagement aufgrund der immer
neuen Entstehung und Ausbreitung von Konflikten weltweit f&#252;r die Einbeziehung
der Menschenrechte bei Konfliktpr&#228;vention, Krisenmanagement und
Unrechtsaufarbeitung fort. Die Beteiligung der EU an den weltweiten Anstrengungen zur
Beendigung der Straflosigkeit auch im Jahr 2019 w&#252;rdigt der Deutsche Bundestag
als wichtigen Beitrag um sicherzustellen, dass die T&#228;ter der schwersten
Verbrechen nach dem V&#246;lkerrecht f&#252;r ihre Taten zur Rechenschaft gezogen werden und
die Opfer von V&#246;lkermord, Kriegsverbrechen und Verbrechen gegen die
Menschlichkeit Gerechtigkeit erfahren. Die EU setzte die Zusammenarbeit mit dem
IStGH fort, unterst&#252;tzte seine Arbeit und setzte sich weiterhin f&#252;r die weltweite 
Ratifizierung und Umsetzung des R&#246;mischen Statuts ein. Umso mehr bedauert
der Deutsche Bundestag, dass die drei st&#228;ndigen Mitgliedsstaaten des VN-
Sicherheitsrates USA, Russland und China dem R&#246;mischen Statut bislang noch immer 
nicht beigetreten sind.
Der Deutsche Bundestag anerkennt das Engagement der EU im 70. Jahr des
Bestehens der Genfer Konventionen f&#252;r die Einhaltung des humanit&#228;ren
V&#246;lkerrechts sowie ihr nachdr&#252;ckliches Eintreten f&#252;r den Schutz der Zivilbev&#246;lkerung
in bewaffneten Konflikten. Der Deutsche Bundestag ist allerdings besorgt
dar&#252;ber, dass es der EU nicht gelingt, alle Mitgliedsl&#228;nder auf die Einhaltung der
Genfer Fl&#252;chtlingskonvention zu verpflichten. Berichte &#252;ber illegale Pushbacks
nimmt der Deutsche Bundestag sehr ernst.
Die EU f&#246;rderte und unterst&#252;tzte die Arbeit des Internationalen Komitees des
Roten Kreuzes (IKRK), einen der vertrauensw&#252;rdigsten Partner der EU und einer der
wichtigsten Partner f&#252;r den Erhalt der Achtung des humanit&#228;ren V&#246;lkerrechts und
der humanit&#228;ren Grunds&#228;tze. 2019 erhielt das IKRK 124,8 Mio. EUR aus dem
EU-Haushalt f&#252;r humanit&#228;re Hilfe.
Konflikte, Gewalt, Armut und fehlende sozio&#246;konomische Perspektiven,
Umweltzerst&#246;rung, Klimawandel sowie Naturkatastrophen und von Menschen
verursachte Katastrophen haben im Berichtszeitraum Menschen zur Flucht aus ihrer
Heimat veranlasst. Ende 2019 lag die Gesamtzahl der Fl&#252;chtlinge bei 79,5
Millionen weltweit. Der Deutsche Bundestag nimmt zur Kenntnis und best&#228;rkt die EU 
in ihrem Bem&#252;hen, sich f&#252;r den Schutz von Fl&#252;chtlingen, &#252;ber Landesgrenzen
hinweg Vertriebenen und Binnenvertriebenen gemeinsam mit internationalen
Partnern und Organisationen der Zivilgesellschaft einzusetzen. Die
Herausforderungen, die sich in diesem Zusammenhang auch mit der Schleusung von
Migranten und mit dem Menschenhandel im Hinblick auf die Menschenrechte stellen,
waren auch im Berichtszeitraum erneut erheblich. Der Deutsche Bundestag
w&#252;rdigt deshalb die unternommenen Anstrengungen der EU, Fluchtursachen zu
minimieren sowie die im Rahmen humanit&#228;rer Hilfe geleistete dringend ben&#246;tigte
Unterst&#252;tzung. Diese erreichte Menschen in lang anhaltenden Konflikten, wie in
Afghanistan und Syrien sowie in Kolumbien und am Horn von Afrika. Im
Berichtszeitraum wurde die EU auch in neuen Krisen, wie der Vertreibungskrise aus
Venezuela, t&#228;tig. 
Gleichzeitig bedauert der Deutsche Bundestag, dass es bislang trotz der
Vorschl&#228;ge f&#252;r eine Neuausrichtung der europ&#228;ischen Migrations- und Asylpolitik
der Europ&#228;ischen Kommission auch im Jahr 2020 nicht gelungen ist, eine
Einigung herbeizuf&#252;hren.
Mit Besorgnis nimmt der Deutsche Bundestag die Berichte &#252;ber die Beteiligung
der EU-Grenzschutzagentur Frontex an Menschenrechtsverletzungen und
illegalen Pushbacks zur Kenntnis. Das in Frontex gesetzte Vertrauen ist gef&#228;hrdet. Um
die Bewertung menschenrechtlich bedenklicher Vorf&#228;lle zu erm&#246;glichen, muss 
Frontex ein wirksames internes Grundrechtemonitoring durchf&#252;hren. Dazu muss 
die Grundrechtebeauftragte besser ausgestattet werden, u.a. indem die bereits
bewilligten Stellen unverz&#252;glich besetzt werden. Ihre unabh&#228;ngige Arbeit muss
garantiert sein.
Die Achtung und der Schutz der Menschenrechte m&#252;ssen immer wieder aufs Neue
eingefordert werden. Diese Aufgabe gewinnt in der Politik und bei den B&#252;rgern
der Europ&#228;ischen Union ein immer gr&#246;&#223;eres Gewicht. Der Deutsche Bundestag
fordert die EU auf, das Amt des Sonderbeauftragten f&#252;r Religions- und
Weltanschauungsfreiheit zeitnah neu zu besetzen, im Bem&#252;hen um eine Einigung auf
eine gemeinsame Migrations- und Asylpolitik nicht nachzulassen sowie die
Menschenrechtslage aller Beitrittskandidaten und potentieller Beitrittskandidaten
weiterhin mit gr&#246;&#223;ter Aufmerksamkeit zu beobachten, konsequent zu ber&#252;cksichtigen
und mit Nachdruck auf die Einhaltung der Menschenrechte zu dr&#228;ngen.&#8220;

1. INTRODUCTION 
The 2019 EU annual report on human rights and democracy in the world marks the final phase of 
implementation of the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy (2015-2019) 1. It presents 
the progress achieved to date, by means of a comprehensive set of actions taken by the European 
External Action Service (EEAS), the European Commission and EU delegations and offices around 
the world. In 2019, the EU demonstrated once again that it is a reliable, cooperative and principled 
global player, working for a better world where all human rights are fully protected and respected.
However, in many parts of the world, challenges remain. Human rights defenders (HRDs), 
journalists and media workers are under threat and attack because of their daily work, civic and 
democratic space continues to be restricted, women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; human rights are being violated, 
and vulnerable groups are often left behind and exposed to further discrimination and inequality. 
Against this background, the international community celebrated in 2019 the 10th anniversary of the 
Charter of Fundamental Rights, the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the 70th anniversary of the Council of Europe and the 100th anniversary of the International 
Labour Organisation. These anniversaries gave great impetus to the EU&#8217;s continuous efforts to
translate its legal and policy frameworks on human rights into reality. The EU worked with all 
partners to turn challenges into opportunities for all human beings, at any time, in any place. 
The 21st EU-NGO Forum on Human Rights, held in Brussels on 3-4 December, put the human 
rights and environment nexus in the spotlight as an emerging challenge and gained unprecedented 
traction. On 9 December 2019, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed on the political appropriateness 
of establishing an EU global human rights sanctions regime to tackle serious human rights 
violations worldwide committed by state and non-state actors.

In 2019, the first ever EU guidelines focusing on economic, social and cultural rights were adopted: 
the EU Human Rights Guidelines on safe drinking water and sanitation. These guidelines opened 
new horizons in promoting the indivisibility of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. 
The Council also adopted Guidelines on non-discrimination in external action and revised 
Guidelines on EU policy towards third countries on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment. Moreover, the Council conclusions on Democracy adopted in October 
provided a comprehensive framework to advance democratic governance.
This report focuses on thematic issues, using a number of country-specific examples, and aims to be 
a practical tool for all stakeholders. Reporting on human rights and democracy at country level can 
be found on the EEAS2 and EU delegations&#8217; webpages.
2. EU SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
The EUSR for Human Rights, Mr Eamon Gilmore, was appointed by Council Decision on 
28 February 2019. Under the authority of the High Representative/Vice President (HR/VP), the 
EUSR is pursuing a broad, flexible mandate, which allows for adaptation to evolving geopolitical 
circumstances. He is working towards the implementation of the Union&#8217;s policy on human rights, 
promoting compliance with international humanitarian law and international criminal justice, and 
the implementation of the Council Decision on the International Criminal Court (ICC), increasing
policy coherence and establishing a stronger European voice through dialogue on human rights.
The EUSR has engaged in an extensive programme since taking up his post in March 2019. This 
has included bilateral visits, active participation in EU human rights dialogues with third countries 
and dedicated engagement with human rights consultations within international and multilateral 
fora. Active engagement is central to advancing the EU&#8217;s human rights policy, and the EUSR is in a 
position to promote EU policy at the highest level in challenging regions and play a significant role 
in efforts to consolidate peace, stability and the rule of law.

Dedication to multilateralism is a key component of the EU&#8217;s commitment to human rights. Just 
after taking up office, EUSR Gilmore travelled to New York for a series of high-level meetings
with the EU Heads of Mission and UN representatives. The EUSR has continued to engage
multilaterally throughout the year, including by holding meetings at the Council of Europe in 
Strasbourg and representing the HR/VP at the CoE Ministerial in Helsinki. In June, the EUSR 
visited Geneva during the 41st session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC), where
he had lengthy and fruitful discussions with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(HCHR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). He highlighted the current 
global human rights challenges and underlined the importance of EU leadership on the human rights 
agenda. 
The EUSR is committed to building upon the Good Human Rights Stories Initiative3, inaugurated in 
2018 at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) by HR/VP Mogherini, UN Secretary-General (UNSG) 
Guterres and UN HCHR Bachelet in collaboration with a cross-regional coalition of 14 UN member
countries. The initiative aims to showcase positive practices around the world by highlighting
effective human rights-based policies in different countries, including those which are not usually
seen as being at the forefront of human rights. This helps to build alliances and to promote a 
positive narrative and positive change, with the aim of having an impact both in the surrounding
regions and globally. In 2019, this impetus was underpinned by the Good Human Rights Stories 
Initiative event at the 74th UNGA in September. The theme was &#8216;building quality lives through
economic, social and cultural rights&#8217;, which allowed member countries to present more &#8216;good 
stories&#8217;. These stories outlined a rich and inspiring picture of progress in areas such as the 
empowerment of women and girls, universal health coverage, victims&#8217; rights, rights to culture and 
rights to parental leave. Colombia joined the Initiative this year, bringing the total number of
countries to 15, in addition to the EU.

The EUSR&#8217;s mandate also focuses on international humanitarian law, international criminal justice 
and the implementation of the Council Decision on the ICC. The EUSR&#8217;s visit to The Hague in 
September was an opportunity to engage with the ICC and other international organisations 
focusing on issues related to international humanitarian law and international criminal justice, as 
well as to gain a deeper appreciation of how the EUSR can work with such actors to fulfil his 
mandate.  
The EUSR has further strengthened the EU&#8217;s presence and engagement through extensive bilateral 
visits. During his mandate, the EUSR is focusing mostly on countries that are strategic EU partners,
neighbourhood countries, countries with significant influence in multilateral human rights fora, 
and/or countries in transition. In May, the EUSR visited Ethiopia and Eritrea, where challenges to 
human rights continue to exist, although progress is slowly but surely being made. The visit to 
Asmara was the first EU high-level visit on human rights issues to Eritrea. This was a significant 
achievement and a step forward in renewed EU-Eritrea relations. The EUSR will continue to focus 
on other countries, as alarming or deteriorating human rights situations may require immediate and
active EU engagement. In June, the EUSR visited Bangladesh and Myanmar/Burma, where he was 
able to send strong messages to the highest level. The precarious situation on the ground and 
extremely difficult conditions in Cox&#8217;s Bazar, which is now the largest refugee camp in the world, 
highlighted the scale of the Rohingya crisis.
The EUSR also engaged in an extensive bilateral agenda during his visit to Washington in July. He
met with senior US officials, political figures, civil society representatives and other stakeholders to 
exchange views on EU human rights priorities both in multilateral human rights fora and in bilateral 
external relations. The EUSR delivered a strong message to US dialogue partners and underlined 
the need to advance a common EU-US human rights agenda. A significant result of the efforts made 
on both sides was the resumption of the EU-US consultations on human rights in December.

In October, the EUSR conducted a bilateral visit to The Gambia (in conjunction with the EU-
African Union human rights dialogue, which took place in Banjul). This included meetings with the 
President, ministers and other stakeholders. After 22 years of dictatorship, the country is undergoing
a democratic transition and wishes to establish itself as &#8216;the human rights capital of the world&#8217;. A 
constitutional reform process is underway, based on inclusive consultations and open 
communication. The Gambia has the potential to be a model for the region and the continent. The 
EU&#8217;s support for the democratic transition has been crucial and must be maintained.
The EUSR has continued to highlight EU priorities by chairing numerous human rights dialogues, 
including with Myanmar/Burma, Colombia, Brazil, Cuba, the African Union (AU) and South 
Africa, and by opening dialogues with China, Belarus and the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN). Through these dialogues, the EU takes part in a mutual exchange that 
encourages open discussion of human rights issues. This platform gives the EUSR an opportunity to 
raise the EU&#8217;s key priorities including the fight against torture, the abolition of the death penalty,
freedom of religion or belief, the protection of human rights defenders, the promotion of women&#8217;s 
and girls&#8217; as well as LGBTI persons&#8217; enjoyment of human rights, freedom of expression, the respect 
of international humanitarian law and accountability for human rights violations and abuses.
Direct involvement of civil society organisations (CSOs) is central to ensuring that the dialogues 
remain focused on results. The EUSR engages regularly with CSOs, including ahead of human 
rights dialogues. Protecting the role of civil society, learning from local and regional human rights 
actors and empowering them to continue their work is a priority for the EUSR. In this context, in 
October the EUSR participated in the Fifth Dublin Platform for Human Rights Defenders, organised 
by Front Line Defenders.

Throughout the year, the EUSR continued to raise the EU&#8217;s profile by representing the EU and the 
HR/VP at the first Global Conference on Media Freedom in the UK, and visiting Washington to 
represent the EU at the second US Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom. He ensured that the 
EU remains at the forefront of the promotion of respect, protection and fulfilment of human rights 
worldwide through active and dedicated participation in panel discussions, academic interactions 
and international conferences focusing on key emerging human rights concerns, such as economic, 
social and cultural rights, business and human rights, human rights and multilateralism, and human 
rights and new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI). 
Looking ahead, the EUSR will continue to build on the work already done, including through
upcoming planned visits and consultations with, inter alia, Ukraine, Belarus, Iran, Cuba and Brazil. 
The EUSR will also support the EEAS and other EU institutions in promoting and implementing
the EU human rights guidelines and the new Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020-
2024. 
3. EU WORK AT MULTILATERAL LEVEL 
In 2019, the EU remained a leader in the universal promotion and protection of human rights at 
multilateral level and continued to support human rights, democracy, the rule of law and gender 
equality in all relevant fora, including the UN Human Rights Council and at the Third Committee of 
the UN General Assembly (UNGA). It also supported the activities of the Office of the High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, specialised UN agencies, and other organisations within the UN system 
such as the International Labour Organisation.

The EU in United Nations human rights fora 
The EU supports the work of the UN human rights system in addressing human rights violations 
and abuses, including through country-specific statements and resolutions, commissions of inquiry, 
fact-finding missions and special procedures, and the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). The EU 
actively supports all those who act against human rights violations and abuses. In 2019, together 
with the EU Member States and like-minded partners worldwide, the EU continued to spearhead 
thematic and country-specific initiatives in the UN human rights fora. The EU championed
crossregional cooperation in multilateral human rights fora to ensure strong results in an increasingly
difficult context characterised by challenges to multilateral institutions and many negative trends 
around the world in the domains of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.

74th Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), Third Committee
The 74th session of the Third Committee of the UNGA4 in October and November 2019 was very
successful in terms of the EU&#8217;s priorities. All 62 resolutions on its agenda for the year &#8211; which 
included EU priority resolutions such as two country-specific resolutions on the human rights 
situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and in Myanmar/Burma, and two 
thematic resolutions on the rights of the child and on freedom of religion or belief &#8211; were adopted, 
and over 76 interactive dialogues with UN mandate holders and senior officials were held. The EU 
also supported important initiatives presented by others, such as the resolution on human rights in
Syria. The consensual adoption of an ambitious text on the rights of the child resolution, led by the
EU and the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States (GRULAC) with 107 countries
cosponsoring, just two days before the UN commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the 
Convention of the Rights of the Child was one of the main achievements of this session. The Third
Committee agreed to start adopting every two years the resolution on the rights of the child. 
However, the UNSG will report at the 75th UNGA session on the implementation of the Convention
on the Rights of the Child. The UNGA Third Committee also adopted a Resolution on Improving
the Coordination Efforts against Trafficking in Human Beings, with a reference for the first time to 
the mandate of the EU Anti-trafficking Coordinator. The resolution reiterates the EU's
longstanding objectives and priorities and the importance of prevention and explicitly encourages
national authorities to end impunity for the perpetrators.
All resolutions adopted can be found on the UN webpage.

The resolution on freedom of religion or belief, a rollover from last year&#8217;s resolution, was adopted 
without a vote again, with 74 countries co-sponsoring the text. The adoption of a joint resolution 
with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on human rights in Myanmar/Burma marks a 
continuation of cooperation with the OIC, which began at the HRC in September and at the 
previous UNGA. The resolution on the human rights situation in the DPRK was tabled by the EU
alone this year, following the pattern from the March HRC session where Japan dropped out as
copenholder. The resolution was adopted without a vote again, with co-sponsorship remaining at the 
same level as in 2018 (61 countries). Regarding the resolution on human rights in Syria, most of the
EU&#8217;s proposals were included in the text, particularly as regards new developments in the north-east 
and north-west of the country, the Constitutional Committee, the International, Impartial and 
Independent Mechanism (IIIM), the Commission of Inquiry, humanitarian access and the use of
chemical weapons. The EU joined the core group on the resolution on the situation of human rights
in Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. The EU maintained unanimity in expressing opposition to 
Russian-tabled resolution on Combating glorification of Nazism.  
During this session, EU- and EU Member States-led initiatives (14 in total) performed well, all 
adopted without a vote or with comfortable voting tallies. The EU participated in most of the 60 
interactive dialogues with UN special procedures and senior officials, and delivered nine general 
statements under the various agenda items. EU Member States worked closely with the EU 
delegation to the UN in New York in support of EU positions, including through burden-sharing on
resolutions and statements.

United Nations Human Rights Council Sessions in 2019 
In 2019, the EU continued to play a leading role in the HRC by advancing thematic priorities and 
addressing country situations of concern through EU-led resolutions and statements, and by
working cross-regionally and supporting action taken by others. Throughout 2019, the EU reiterated
its long-standing position that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated. All resolutions adopted can be found on the UN webpage5 and the EU&#8217;s statements are
available on the EEAS website6 . 
At the 40th session in March 2019, the EU was very active and made a strong mark by presenting
five resolutions. The resolution on the human rights situation in the DPRK, led by the EU and 
adopted by consensus, recalled the dire human rights situation in the country and extended the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur. The EU-led resolution on the human rights situation in 
Myanmar/Burma, which aimed to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, received strong
cross-regional support. The EU also co-sponsored the resolution on cooperation with Georgia. On 
the thematic side, the EU also presented a resolution on the rights of the child, focusing on 
empowering children with disabilities to ensure their full enjoyment of their human rights, including 
through inclusive education. The EU, together with partners from all over the world, continued to 
build on its initiative on the freedom of religion or belief.

At the 41st session in June 2019, the EU took a clear stance on issues of gender equality, calling for 
the full enjoyment of all human rights by women and girls and their empowerment. The EU actively
participated in the negotiations on all gender-related resolutions presented during the session, 
including on violence against women, discrimination against women and the resolution by the 
African Group on female genital mutilation (FGM). The renewal of the mandate of the Independent 
Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender 
identity was an EU priority and was adopted by a vote. The EU-led resolution on the human rights 
situation in Belarus, which expressed continued concern at the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in the country and renewed the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, was 
adopted with more votes in favour than in previous years.
The 42nd session in September 2019 reflected the EU&#8217;s active and continuous efforts to seek new 
partnerships and work across regions to protect human rights. The resolution on Myanmar/Burma, 
led by the EU and the OIC, was voted for by an overwhelming majority. The resolution focused on 
accountability and ensuring continued political attention to the situation in Myanmar/Burma. The 
EU also presented a resolution on Burundi, in light of the continuing grave human rights situation, 
which renewed the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry (CoI), allowing it to intensify its 
investigations. The EU committed to keep the situations in Yemen, Syria, and Venezuela under the 
scrutiny of the HRC and supported the HRC&#8217;s resolute actions on human rights violations in these
countries.

The EU in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe
The EU continued to engage in dialogue and cooperation within the &#8216;human dimension&#8217; of the 
comprehensive security concept of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE).  
The EU actively participated in all human dimension events, namely the Human Dimension 
Implementation Meeting (HDIM) in Warsaw, 16-27 September 2019, the three Supplementary
Human Dimension Meetings, and all the meetings of the Human Dimension Committee. During the 
HDIM, the EU spoke at all sessions, participated in side events (co-sponsoring one on torture 
prevention) and held bilateral meetings with civil society representatives. The EU actively called for
the open and broad participation of CSOs in OSCE events. 
In the OSCE Permanent Council, the EU addressed several issues, including marking World Press 
Freedom Day, the International Day against the Death Penalty, the International Day for the 
Elimination of Violence against Women, and Human Rights Day. It also raised individual human 
rights cases and developments, in particular from Russia, Turkey and Azerbaijan. The EU was also 
one of the drivers of the joint statement marking the International Day in Support of Victims of 
Torture.
The Ministerial Council concluded with no decision or declaration in the human dimension, due to a 
lack of consensus. The EU actively engaged in the negotiations with the aim of adopting a decision
on torture prevention or on the freedom of peaceful assembly.
The EU continued to fully support the valuable work of the OSCE&#8217;s autonomous institutions (the 
Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights &#8211; ODIHR, the Representative on Freedom of 
the Media and the High Commissioner on National Minorities).

As regards election observation, the EU and the OSCE share common goals, standards and a similar
methodology. Their ongoing efforts to strengthen the methodology for observing the use of new 
technologies in the electoral process and to follow up on recommendations from election 
observation missions (EOM) are examples of cooperation to support democracy and promote 
human rights. In 2019, the EU supported the work carried out by the ODIHR to assist the OSCE 
participating states, for instance by funding projects to follow up on elections-related 
recommendations in the Western Balkans and to build a comprehensive justice system to respond to 
hate crimes. The EU was also the major donor behind an OSCE-led survey on the well-being and 
safety of women. The findings of the survey were published in 2019 and the EU actively took part 
in several events in Vienna, Brussels and Warsaw to raise awareness of these issues. 
Following an exchange of letters between the Secretaries-General of the European Commission, the 
EEAS, and the OSCE, a mid-year meeting took place in June 2019 to take stock of the cooperation.

The EU in the Council of Europe 
On 5 May 2019, the Council of Europe (CoE) celebrated its 70th anniversary. Throughout the year, 
the CoE faced unprecedented challenges and continuous violations of CoE principles. In line with 
its priorities for cooperation with the CoE in 2018-197, the EU continued to support the CoE in 
defending and promoting human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The partnership between the 
EU and the CoE is based on three pillars: high-level political dialogue, legal cooperation and 
financial support. The EU strongly supports the role of the European Court of Human Rights and 
the CoE convention system as the principal instruments for defending human rights in Europe. The 
joint EU-CoE programmes in the EU enlargement region and in the Eastern Partnership and
Southern Mediterranean countries continued, in 2019, to provide extensive and substantial expertise 
on strengthening the capacity of partner countries&#8217; institutions to implement domestic reforms and 
to bring them closer to CoE and EU standards in the fields of human rights, democracy and the rule 
of law. 
The EU continued to foster cooperation with civil society, to mainstream gender equality and 
women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; empowerment in all areas, to promote effective youth policies, education and 
training, to accelerate the implementation of the youth, peace and security agenda, and to address 
migration, with particular attention to the needs of migrants in vulnerable situations: women at risk, 
children, persons with disabilities, people who are discriminated against on any basis, and victims 
of violence. The EU called upon countries to ratify and implement the CoE Convention on 
Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, also known as the &#8216;Lanzarote 
Convention&#8217;.

In 2019, progress was made in a number of areas of EU-CoE cooperation. On 10 July, the CoE&#8217;s 
Committee of Ministers adopted by consensus the decision granting the EU observer status in the 
Group of States against Corruption (GRECO). EU participation in GRECO as an observer brings
real added value, not least by facilitating joint work on capacity building and implementing
standards intended to strengthen the rule of law and the fight against corruption. The Commission 
Communication of July 2019 on further strengthening of the rule of law within the Union8 
underlines the importance of the European Court of Human Rights&#8217; case law and the expert 
opinions of bodies such as the Venice Commission and GRECO. 
The EU remained fully committed to its accession to the European Convention on Human Rights 
(ECHR). Article 6(2) TEU provides for the legal basis and the obligation for the EU to accede to 
the ECHR. On 7 October 2019, the Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted supplementary EU 
negotiating directives with a view to resuming the negotiations with the other CoE states on 
amendments to the draft accession agreement of 2013.
The EU in the International Labour Organisation
In 2019, which marked the 100th anniversary of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the 
EU was a key actor in the ILO Centenary Labour Conference. On 21 June, the Conference adopted 
the Violence and Harassment Convention of the ILO (Convention 190), supplemented by a 
recommendation (Recommendation 206). The Convention sets out the first ever binding, globally
applicable standards on eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work. It recognises the 
right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment, including sexual and 
gender-based violence and harassment, and states that violence and harassment in the world of work 
can constitute a human rights violation or abuse. The recommendation provides detailed guidance 
on preventing and combating violence and harassment and protecting its victims.

The adoption of these new instruments led to a historic moment in the protection of the right to 
decent work and &#8211; due to the prominent role given to sexual and gender-based violence and 
harassment &#8211; emphasised the right of women to live free from violence in the world of work. The 
EU and its Member States played a critical role, constantly engaging with governments from all 
regions and with workers&#8217; and employers&#8217; organisations to build consensus on the instruments. 
The Conference also adopted the ILO Centenary Declaration for the Future of Work, which sets out 
guidelines for a human-centred approach to the changes taking place in the world of work, with a 
focus on labour and social protection for all, gender equality, lifelong learning and a just transition 
to an environmentally sustainable future of work. The Conference called for the ratification and 
implementation of core labour standards and launched a process for the integration of safe and 
healthy working conditions in the ILO&#8217;s framework of fundamental principles and rights at work.
Furthermore, the EU and its Member States stood firm in support of the ILO&#8217;s standard supervisory
system. At the Conference, they delivered EU statements on the application of labour standards in 
17 countries on issues such as freedom of association and collective bargaining, child labour, forced
labour and discrimination. The EU also actively engaged with the ILO Governing Body on such 
matters, supporting its work to ensure freedom of association by closely following cases of threats 
and violence against trade unionists. 
With the full support of the EU, the ILO has been instrumental in the progress made in 2019 in 
Qatar, with three key reforms: the removal of the exit visa and the right of workers to change
employer freely, which together finalise the abolition of the sponsorship (kafala) system, and a
nondiscriminatory minimum wage.

4. DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE
In October 2019, for the first time in a decade, the EU foreign ministers adopted Council 
conclusions on Democracy9. With this political statement, the EU renewed its commitment to a 
founding value of the Union10 and to the universality11 of democracy. These conclusions provide a 
comprehensive framework to advance democratic governance.
Supporting democracy is a strategic interest of the Union that contributes to the achievement of key
objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and is an enabler of the 2030 Agenda, in 
particular promoting accountable institutions and inclusive and participatory decision-making (Goal 
16), reducing inequalities (Goal 10) and reaching gender equality (Goal 5).
Since the Council conclusions on Democracy support12 of 2009, the global context has profoundly
changed. The rules-based international order is under attack, human rights are increasingly under 
pressure around the globe, and the quality of democracy and the space for civil society are in 
decline.13 In the digital age, new opportunities for political participation have emerged, but so have
major challenges, including incitement to violence or hatred, disinformation campaigns, as well as 
violations and abuses of human rights online, such as freedom of expression. Moreover,
microtargeting of political messaging is violating the right to privacy.

The new conclusions call for urgent and common responses to these challenges and commit the EU 
and Member States to a detailed set of practical commitments. These include: longstanding
priorities such as promoting participative, accountable and democratic institutions; supporting
transparent and credible electoral processes; fostering the rule of law and the independence of 
justice; and empowering civil society. In addition, they include newer approaches such as: 
strengthening support to parliaments and political parties; building civic and political space; 
supporting and protecting independent media; addressing the shrinking democratic space online, as
well as challenges to democracy posed by digital technologies; putting greater effort into following
up on the recommendations of EU election observation missions; and combating inequality in order 
to rebuild trust in democracy and democratic institutions. A specific focus is given to human rights 
defenders, journalists, women and young people in all actions.
Following the adoption of the Council conclusions, the EU participated (with its own panel for the 
first time) in the World Forum for Democracy organised by the CoE on 6-8 November 2019 in 
Strasbourg. This panel was an opportunity to raise awareness about the EU&#8217;s work to support 
democracy externally and internally and about the complementarity of the EU&#8217;s and the CoE&#8217;s work
on democracy support.
Cooperation projects in support of democracy in 2019 amounted to EUR 147 million in 37 
countries. These projects supported the development of accountable institutions, the organisation of 
elections, support for national parliaments, and the development of independent and quality media. 
A European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) Global Call for Proposals 
focused on leveraging digital tools to support democratic participation and awarded three grants to 
projects from Central Asia, Brazil and Cambodia. These will support media literacy and the fight
against hate speech and disinformation. Another EIDHR Global Call was launched for projects 
promoting accountability, transparency, scrutiny and a review of the implementation of public 
policies. 
Together with civil society organisations, the EU organised the 2019 International Day of 
Democracy, based on the theme &#8216;No Democracy without Accountability&#8217;.

The Parliaments in Partnership Programme, a new EU project to strengthen the capacity of
parliaments (INTER PARES)14, was launched in July to strengthen the capacity of parliaments 
through the sharing of expertise between parliaments of EU Member States and parliaments of EU
partner countries. 
The project Supporting Democracy, which ended in 2019, helped civil society organisations to find 
innovative tools to promote civic participation. CSOs met together with EU delegations in Malaysia
and Lebanon to discuss ways to improve the use of new technologies for active citizenship in closed 
civic spaces. As a follow up to these meetings, the EU is working to increase its staff&#8217;s awareness of 
the opportunities and challenges of new technologies. A round table on the potential effects of AI
on democracy support was organised in December 2019.
In addition, in 2019 the EU continued to provide support to elections in the Western Balkans 
through the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. In particular, it supported 
institutions and civil society in this region in their efforts to follow up on election observation 
recommendations in areas related to election management, voter registration and the role and work
of the media during election campaigns.
In the course of the year, the EU also provided technical support to several countries in the world. 
For instance, under the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA), the EU began assisting
Bosnia and Herzegovina&#8217;s development of a five-year strategy and corresponding action plan to 
improve the integrity, transparency and efficiency of the election process. 
The EU also continued to work with the CoE on issues related to the promotion of democracy. For 
instance, in Ukraine, a joint project on media freedom aims, inter alia, to ensure balanced and 
professional media coverage of the 2019-2020 elections.

During 2019, the European Endowment for Democracy (EED) continued to be a key EU partner in 
the enlargement and neighbourhood countries, supporting initiatives in several areas, ranging from 
election observation and awareness raising of specific issues such as the need to vote and voters&#8217; 
rights, to the training of inexperienced activists on participation in elections. Furthermore, the EED 
supports media monitoring and social surveys, for example monitoring citizens&#8217; attitudes towards 
elections.  
Participation of persons belonging to Roma communities in local elections in the Republic 
of Moldova 
Roma in the Republic of Moldova are significantly under-represented in local and national 
decision-making. East Europe Foundation (EEF) engaged in a strategic partnership with Tarna
Rom (Roma NGO), working jointly to empower Roma to stand as candidates in the local 
elections. To this end, during 2018-2019, EEF and Tarna Rom trained 100 Roma participants 
from 48 localities on political leadership, successful public communication and efficient election 
campaigns. The trainings, along with subsequent dialogue events with political parties, 
contributed to an increased number of Roma candidates in the candidates&#8217; lists.
The election monitoring from the perspective of Roma, conducted by EEF and Tarna Rom for the 
first time in the Republic of Moldova, revealed 42 Roma persons running for the position of local 
counsellor, 17 Roma candidates registered for the position of district counsellor, and three Roma 
persons running for the position of mayor. As a result, 12 Roma communities' representatives 
were elected as local counsellors. This is a moderate, yet important step towards more inclusive 
decision-making and a cohesive society in the Republic of Moldova.
In 2019, the European Parliament (EP) continued to support parliaments and parliament-related 
players via its well-established election observation activities, capacity-building programmes, 
human rights actions and mediation and dialogue initiatives, and completed its democracy support 
work under the Comprehensive Democracy Support Approach in the 8th parliamentary legislature.

The Western Balkans remained a priority region with strong political support for its democratic 
institutions, which was highlighted by the high-level roundtable discussing their European 
perspective. The Jean Monnet Dialogue (JMD) for Peace and Democracy15 continued with the 
Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia during 2019, demonstrating the EU&#8217;s commitment 
to the country&#8217;s accession aspirations. A new Inter-Party Dialogue was established with the 
Parliament of the Republic of Serbia focused on improving the culture of political dialogue amongst
the political parties. 
The EP&#8217;s democracy support work in the European Neighbourhood included various activities with 
the parliaments of Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and Morocco. The JMD recommenced with the 
Verkhovna Rada (Supreme Council) of Ukraine. One highlight of the EP&#8217;s work on the Youth, 
Peace and Security (YPS) agenda was the introduction of the EP&#8217;s flagship Young Political Leaders 
Programmes in Armenia/Azerbaijan and Israel/Palestine16 for discussions on common challenges 
and best practices as young peacebuilders.
At the beginning of the 9th legislature, the EP reconfirmed the Comprehensive Democracy Support 
Approach as a guiding principle for its democracy support work, which is primarily focused on
preaccession assistance and neighbouring countries. A number of new instruments such as 
Parliamentary Electoral Dialogues and Train the Trainers were endorsed by the EP as an important 
part of its democracy support in the coming years.
Election observation missions (EOMs) are a highly visible demonstration of the EU&#8217;s commitment 
to supporting democracy and promoting respect for human rights and the rule of law across the 
world. In 2019, the EU deployed eight election observation missions (in El Salvador, Kosovo17*, 
Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Sri Lanka, and Tunisia) and seven election expert missions 
were deployed in partner countries (in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Maldives, 
Mauretania and South Africa).

The EU further strengthened its work on the follow-up of the implementation of EOM 
recommendations, which is a crucial element in the deepening of democracy in partner countries. 
More election follow-up missions (EFMs) were deployed (in El Salvador, Ghana, The Gambia, 
Honduras, Myanmar/Burma, Paraguay and Zambia) and systematic efforts were made to better link 
the work of EU election missions and technical assistance supporting electoral reform. In addition, 
the EU has developed a public database, which provides access to a central repository of
recommendations issued by EU EOMs since 2016.
The EU supported local electoral observers in Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Comoros, Georgia, 
Madagascar, Mauritania, Moldova, Papua New Guinea, Thailand and Ukraine.
The European Union Database on Election Missions 
Recommendations can be searched, by year, region/country, type of mission, type of election and 
type of recommendation. Moreover, the database provides easy access to final reports of EU
election missions, preliminary statements and press releases since 2000, and offers information on 
the status of implementation of recommendations by country. Hence, it is a useful tool for civil 
society organisations, citizens, and international election observers and EU delegations advocating
for the implementation of recommendations as well as for anyone interested in research and 
analysis on EU EOM recommendations and tracking progress on their implementation.18

With the use of social media in electoral processes having grown exponentially across the world, 
the EU has also adapted its observation methodology. It has developed a specific set of 
methodological guidelines to enable a more systematic analysis of both online media campaigns 
and the policy frameworks, to ensure that offline electoral standards also apply online. These new 
guidelines have been tested by dedicated small teams of analysts during the 2019 EOMs in Nigeria, 
Tunisia and Sri Lanka. Based on the initial successful outcomes, the methodology will be further 
fine-tuned and systematically applied to all future EU EOMs. Incorporating the digital dimension of 
elections into EOMs will allow the EU to support countries across the globe in developing the kind 
of policy frameworks necessary to handle new challenges to democratic elections through the 
follow-up to the recommendations. 
5. ENABLING SPACE FOR CIVIL SOCIETY  
During 2019 the EU continued to follow up on the Communication entitled &#8216;The roots of 
democracy and sustainable development: Europe&#8217;s engagement with civil society in external 
relations&#8217; as well as the 2017 Council conclusions19 reaffirming that members of civil society
organisations are both actors of governance and development actors in their own right, and are, as 
such, key partners for the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
The EU (through its network of EU delegations and offices and through interaction with and 
support for CSOs) regularly addresses threats to civil society and democratic space and seeks to 
formulate coherent and effective responses to this problem.  
Engaging with and empowering civil society remained at the forefront of EU&#8217;s action. The EU
opposed, through public and private messaging, unjustified restrictions to civil society space, such 
as restrictive legislation, limits on registration and financing, smear campaigns and any attempts to 
hinder the work of civil society in a number of countries.

In 2019, the revision of the country roadmaps for the EU&#8217;s engagement with civil society for 2018-
2020 continued. For most, the first priority remained an enabling environment for civil society. A 
number of the new roadmaps aim to open up spaces for dialogue and, where possible, to influence 
and counterbalance the trend towards a narrowing operating space for both CSOs and individuals. 
Roadmaps are also helping to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the 
protection of human rights defenders, particularly in fragile contexts and where space for CSOs is 
shrinking.
In line with current practice, consultations throughout the year with civil society and human rights 
defenders took place in Brussels and in third countries before the launch of calls for proposals for 
the implementation of the activities and ahead of human rights dialogues. The EU continued to 
carry out debriefings for civil society following the human rights dialogues. A joint note issued in 
2019 by the EEAS and the European Commission entitled &#8216;Seven Tips for Meaningful Engagement 
of Civil Society Organisations in the Roll-Out of the European Neighbourhood Policy&#8217; aimed to 
help delegations to engage with civil society in the neighbourhood.
Civil society representatives regularly engaged with the Council Working Party on Human Rights 
(COHOM) and are systematically debriefed on its conclusions. In 2019, a number of targeted events 
took place in Brussels, such as the 21st EU-NGO Forum on building a fair environmental future, the 
second Majalat Civil Society Forum in December 2019, as well as the European Development Days
(EDD) in June 2019.  
The Commission has furthermore fostered strategic global and regional dialogue with CSOs 
through its longstanding Policy Forum on Development (PFD), an opportunity to exchange with 
CSOs from across the world on the state of civil society and on policy priorities. In 2019, the topic 
of an enabling environment was on the agenda of both the Third Asia Regional meeting in Nepal on
24-26 September 2019 and the global 2019 PFD meeting in Brussels on 13-15 March 2019.

In addition, in the margins of human rights dialogues with partner countries, CSOs were also 
invited to participate in civil society seminars financed under the EIDHR, the Service for Foreign 
Policy Instruments (FPI) and the Civil Society Organisations and Local Authorities (CSO-LA) 
thematic programme. In 2019, civil society seminars were organised in the margins of the human 
rights dialogues with Cuba, Indonesia, ASEAN, the AU and Brazil among others. In multilateral 
fora, the EU intensified its engagement in promoting NGO participation in the work of the HRC, 
including by defending NGOs&#8217; right to speak. Moreover, in 2019, the EU and Member States 
supported a successful referral to votes at the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in order to 
overturn repeated deferrals of NGO applications by the UN Committee on Non-Governmental 
Organisations.  
The EU maintained a ban on exports of equipment for internal repression and continued to control 
the export of certain other goods, which could be used for the manufacture and maintenance of 
equipment for internal repression of civil society.
Throughout 2019, the EU continued its efforts to safeguard the space for human rights policy in the 
context of EU political and cooperation agreements and trade policy. It included specific human 
rights provisions in such agreements and ensured the involvement of civil society organisations in 
their implementation. 
In the candidate and potential candidate countries of the EU, the state of social dialogue and larger 
socio-economic issues related to the countries&#8217; Economic Reform Programmes were discussed with 
workers&#8217; and employers&#8217; organisations. Through the Employment and Social Affairs Platform in 
the Western Balkans, the EU supports with ILO assistance the development of tripartite bodies 
involving governments, trade unions and employers&#8217; associations.
The EU has supported civil society through existing financial instruments and by adapting funding
modalities, for example in order to enable organisations in exile to receive funds. Building on past 
successes in helping human rights defenders under threat, a new generation of emergency funding
was activated in 2019.

Civil society organisations are the main recipients of support from the EIDHR and the CSO-LA
thematic programme. Through the 25 Framework Partnership Agreements (FPAs) under the CSO-
LA programme, CSOs are supported as key contributors to policy-making at regional and global 
levels. Some of the FPAs (including the International Federation for Human Rights, CIVICUS, 
Forum Asia) directly promote an enabling environment and address shrinking civic space. 
Moreover, through the priorities of the CSO-LA programme as well as civil and political rights and 
governance work under EIDHR, the EU supports the promotion of a conducive environment for 
CSOs in partner countries.
Learning from the experience of the FPAs under the CSO-LA programme, FPAs were also signed 
in 2019 in Kosovo, Ukraine, and at regional level for the Eastern Neighbourhood. Thorough these 
strategic partnerships, the EU will establish long-term cooperation with the selected CSOs and 
channel support more effectively, with higher impact on the ground. In addition, small and flexible 
grants through a Rapid Response Mechanism have continued to allow CSOs to react to unexpected 
changes in the enabling space for civil society across the wider Eastern Neighbourhood region.
Building on its key strength, which is the ability to operate without the need for host government 
consent, the EIDHR was able to focus on sensitive issues and innovative approaches, and to 
cooperate directly with isolated or marginalised CSOs. In particular, the exceptional conditions of 
the EIDHR Human Rights Crises Facility allow the EU to allocate direct grants to CSOs operating
in particularly severe and difficult human rights and democracy contexts. In addition, specific 
democracy initiatives were implemented to promote an enabling space (e.g. Supporting Democracy,
Media4Democracy, Civic Tech 4 Democracy). The EU also provides financial support to the UN 
Special Rapporteurs on freedom of association and peaceful assembly and on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, which are crucial in ensuring an 
enabling environment for civil society. The EU also promotes an enabling environment for civil 
society through the implementation of methodological approaches such as gender mainstreaming
and the rights-based approach (RBA) to development cooperation, that empower EU delegations to 
act on human rights in all sectors of their work. This multifaceted support helps to combat 
restrictive laws and practices impeding the work of independent civil society.

National Human Rights Institutions 
National human rights institutions (NHRIs) are crucial actors in the broader human rights 
architecture and in enabling rights-based development processes. However, they are affected by the
deteriorating situation of shrinking democratic and civic space for independent human rights action.
In 2019, the EU continued to monitor the multiple challenges that NHRIs face in fulfilling their 
mandates. The EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2015-19 identified NHRIs as key
EU partners and acknowledged their essential role in the promotion and protection of human rights. 
The EU is firmly committed to supporting and engaging with those institutions, the work of which 
is in line with the Paris Principles, as well as those striving to comply with the said principles.
As a follow-up to the EU Action Plan&#8217;s commitment to strengthen the involvement of NHRIs in 
consultation processes at country level, in 2019, NHRIs were present during the EU human rights 
dialogues with Morocco, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan.
Financial support complements the EU&#8217;s political commitment to NHRIs. While ad hoc support was
given to NHRIs in the past, a new, stronger commitment to supporting NHRIs has been 
demonstrated by the adoption of the EIDHR Regulation for 2014-20. The EIDHR currently funds 
two strategic, targeted programmes to support NHRIs: 
&#8211; A targeted programme entitled &#8216;Capacity Building of National Human Rights Institutions&#8217; 
(NHRI.EU phase 2), which started in January 2019 for a period of three years with an EU 
contribution of EUR 3.75 million. The aim of the programme is not only to support the capacity of
NHRIs, but also to support cooperation with their regional and international networks and to further
strengthen the Global Alliance of NHRIs. The Danish Institute for Human Rights is the lead 
applicant, with the UN-recognised global and regional NHRI secretariats as co-applicants (Global 
Alliance of NHRIs, Asia-Pacific Forum, Network of African NHRIs and the European Network of
NHRIs). The Network of NHRIs in the Americas (RINDHCA), recognised as having legal
personality by the Ministry of Government of Panama on 7 June 2019, will be added to the 
programme as a further co-applicant.
&#8211; A second targeted programme providing EUR 1 million to the European Network of NHRIs,
intended to enhance the effectiveness of NHRIs in promoting and protecting human rights in 
situations of conflict or post-conflict in wider Europe through capacity building, dialogue and 
cooperation between concerned NHRIs, and engagement with national, regional and international 
actors.

6. HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS 
In 2019, the EU continued to relentlessly support human rights defenders, to denounce the shrinking 
space for civil society, and to use political and financial action to support those fighting for human 
rights, in particular when they are at risk. The situation across the world remained extremely
difficult with increasing reprisals such as harassment, arrests and attacks, including cyber-attacks, 
and killings of human rights defenders (HRDs)20 . 
The cooperation between EU delegations and the EU Member States&#8217; missions continues to be one 
of the most effective tools for translating the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders into 
concrete actions on the ground. Such actions include more regular reporting; increasing public 
support to HRDs, including the creation of new Human Rights Defenders&#8217; Awards; increased EU 
presence during trial observation; opposing unjustified restrictions such as travel bans and asset 
freezes imposed on individuals as a deterrent to their human rights activism; defending an enabling
environment for human rights defenders through political and policy dialogue with partner 
countries; speaking out against cases of intimidation, harassment or reprisals; sending strong
messages during country visits and enhancing HRDs&#8217; protection with country-specific projects.
For example, the implementation of the burden-sharing mechanism between the EU delegations and
the Member States rendered the monitoring of the HRDs&#8217; situation more effective.
Filter Group in Guatemala
The Filter Group (led by the EU delegation and composed of EU Member States, Switzerland, 
Canada, the USA, and the OHCHR and UNHCR country offices) supported the work of human 
rights defenders. Support included periodic meetings with defenders (12), visits to remote areas of 
high risk for defenders, attendance at judicial hearings, communiqu&#233;s, visits to imprisoned 
defenders, and periodic meetings with justice operators and institutions in charge of the protection 
of human rights defenders to follow up on 27 cases of attacks against defenders and cases of 
defenders subject to legal processes. 
20 Since 2005, the EU has supported more than 30 000 human rights defenders.

At the UNGA Third Committee, the EU actively engaged in negotiations led by Norway on the 
resolution on human rights defenders. In the UN Human Rights Council, the EU supported the 
Norwegian-led resolution on human rights defenders working on environmental matters. The 
resolution recognised the contribution of environmental human rights defenders to the enjoyment of
human rights, environmental protection and sustainable development. Reaching consensus on this 
crucial issue was a significant step forward. At its September session, the HRC emphatically
endorsed a resolution on reprisals against those cooperating with the UN, its institutions and 
mechanisms in the field of human rights, an initiative that was strongly supported by EU Member
States. 
In 2019, the EU supported the triennial HRC resolution on the mandate of the UN Special 
Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association and continued to support 
him, as well as the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights defenders, and on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; their work is crucial to 
counter the deteriorating working environment for HRDs. The EU actively pursued its cooperation 
with international and regional mechanisms in charge of protecting HRDs, including by
participating in the ninth inter-mechanism meeting on the protection of HRDs, a joint initiative of
the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture 
(OMCT), which was hosted by the OSCE ODIHR in Warsaw on 18 September. This was attended 
by, amongst others, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders, the OSCE ODIHR 
Director, the Office of the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights and the EU 
Fundamental Rights Agency. Participants exchanged views on the impact of national security and 
counter-terrorism laws on HRDs&#8217; protection, strategies to reassert the legitimacy, achievements and 
positive role of HRDs, as well as the participation of HRDs in the work of inter-governmental 
organisations. A side event followed in the margins of the OSCE HDIM on HRDs&#8217; protection, 
featuring international and regional mechanisms and institutions.
Human rights defenders - especially those working on human rights issues related to land, the 
environment and extractive industries - have been subject to particularly severe repression, 
including killings. As part of the EU&#8217;s specific commitment to step up efforts to protect human 
rights defenders, the EU-NGO Human Rights Forum on 3-4 December 2019 in Brussels brought 
together HRDs from more than 90 countries to discuss how to build a fair environmental future.

EU statements raised the cases of certain HRDs in the OSCE Permanent Council meetings and in 
the annual OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting in Warsaw. The EU also actively
contributed to the Human Dimension Committee meeting dedicated to HRDs in December 2019, 
highlighting the EU&#8217;s policy and financial contribution to HRDs, as well as calling on all OSCE 
participating states to implement the relevant existing commitments (considering that some 
participating states are questioning the concept of human rights defenders). The EU statement 
marking the Human Rights Day in the OSCE Permanent Council focused on HRDs and on the 
challenges that they face within the OSCE area.
The EU remained a major donor to the protection of HRDs under the EIDHR, which is the world&#8217;s 
largest programme dedicated to human rights and democracy (EUR 1.3 billion for the period 2014-
2020). 
The EIDHR funds the EU human rights defenders mechanism, ProtectDefenders.eu (EUR 20 
million for 2015-2019). It has provided support to more than 30 000 HRDs and their families since 
2015 through a combination of short, medium and long-term initiatives (including direct support, 
training, advocacy and outreach activities). The mechanism was renewed in November 2019 for 
another three years with a budget of EUR 15 million. The EU is particularly engaged in supporting
women human rights defenders (WHRDs), given the prominent role they play in defending human 
rights and the gender-based obstacles they face. Therefore, one of the new components of the 
renewed mechanism will address the need to enhance a gender-sensitive approach. Another novelty
is the support for shelter initiatives for HRDs at risk, in particular at regional and local levels.
The EU emergency fund for human rights defenders at risk, which has been in place since 2010 and 
is directly managed by the EU, has supported over 1 000 human rights defenders and their family
members since 2014. This direct financial support contributes to the effective implementation of the
EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders by EU delegations and EU Member States and is 
complementary to political action in protection of HRDs. The emergency fund provides crucial, 
often vital, assistance to HRDs, allowing them to continue their legitimate human rights work.

The EIDHR Human Rights Crises Facility provides flexible grants to civil society and human rights
defenders working in extremely difficult conditions and/or where the publication of a call for
proposals would be inappropriate. In 2019, six facility projects had re-granting and the capacity
building of HRDs among their main objectives.
#WeDefendLife &#8211; A campaign to raise the voice of human right defenders in Colombia
The campaign #WeDefendLife (#DefendamosLaVida) has been a successful example of digital 
diplomacy and engagement to articulate the efforts made by the EU and its Member States (plus 
Switzerland) in Colombia. Together, the embassies have prioritised 40 cases of human rights
defenders all around the Colombian territory whose life and processes are under threat, 
supporting them and showing them that they are not alone. Every embassy has engaged in one or 
more cases to monitor them and give the human rights defenders concerned visibility before the 
authorities, society and the media in order to prevent stigmatisation and call for their protection. 
7. FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND MEDIA FREEDOM
The EU&#8217;s mandate in this area is framed by the Guidelines on Freedom of Expression Online and 
Offline and the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy. In 2019, a number of relevant 
actions were implemented as part of the European Consensus for Development21 and Sustainable 
Development Goal 16.10.  
In 2019, the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Expression Online and Offline were highlighted on 
many occasions. Several statements and declarations were issued on the freedom of expression, 
either by the HR/VP or in the context of the EU&#8217;s work within the UN, OSCE and the Council of 
Europe. On some occasions, local statements were agreed by EU delegations with Member States 
and like-minded countries. 
&#8216;The New European Consensus on Development &#8211; Our World, Our Dignity, Our Future&#8217;, 
adopted in June 2017 jointly by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.

The EU systematically raised the issues of freedom of expression and press freedom in the political
and human rights dialogues with partner countries, among others with Cuba, Pakistan, South Africa 
and Indonesia.  
The EU continued to closely and effectively collaborate on these issues with the OSCE, the Council 
of Europe and with the specialised UN agencies. 
The EU supported the work of the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression and intends to strengthen direct cooperation.
Regional and local events were also organised, such as the events in the context of the EU-Western 
Balkans Media Days. At the 2019 event, a panel of leading journalists, fact-checkers and academics 
discussed the state of play in the region and ways forward on countering disinformation. 
In 2019, journalists and media workers continued to be the target of psychological, physical and 
digital attacks. Acts of intimidation and harassment were reported in all regions, often accompanied 
by a refusal by state authorities to effectively investigate. The EU provided support, including legal 
assistance to journalists at risk via the mechanisms for HRDs and the work of the European Centre 
for Press and Media Freedom. In many countries, financial support was provided locally to foster 
the protection of journalists, bloggers and media workers.
The Media4Democracy project continued to provide technical assistance to EU delegations 
throughout the year, building the capacity of EU delegations&#8217; and Member States&#8217; staff to 
sustainably implement the Guidelines on Freedom of Expression in different local contexts, while 
increasing direct engagement with journalists, media institutions and civil society. The project 
provided targeted media assessments in Malaysia and Burundi; means to strengthen the media to 
enhance gender equality in Burkina Faso and Malaysia; three fellowship programmes in Tanzania, 
Rwanda and Kyrgyzstan; legal analysis to strengthen the freedom of expression in Russia; work to 
counter hate speech and disinformation in Indonesia; and actions supporting the media in restricted 
and highly dangerous contexts.

Two EIDHR global calls were dedicated to supporting civic activism and participation by
leveraging digital technologies, and projects were selected: (i) for Brazil, to ensure that uses of
robots in social media to promote disinformation are faced with transparency and media literacy
practices; (ii) for Cambodia, to empower young ethnic minority community citizens to make
government more participatory, transparent, responsive and accountable, including by leveraging
digital technologies, in Ratanakiri, Mondulkiri, Koh Kong and Kampot; and (iii) for Central Asia, to
incentivise vulnerable youth in remote areas to participate in online and mobile educational games 
that build their critical thinking, and to expand access to online information and educational tools.
Ensuring freedom of expression and media freedom remained one of the main challenges facing the 
EU candidate countries. Political interference in the media sector, economic sustainability of 
independent outlets, concentration of media ownership and various forms of intimidation, including
violence against journalists and other media workers, are topical issues and improving this situation 
goes beyond a simple transposition of EU rules: it calls for behavioural and cultural change in 
politics, the judiciary and the media. The EU continued to support this process by providing legal 
assistance and guidance in drafting media legislation and thoroughly monitoring the policies of
candidate countries and potential candidates.
The financial support through the IPA programmes was based on the strategy and the policy vision 
set out at the Speak-up! conferences and the EU-Western Balkans Media Days (the last one was 
held in Podgorica on 12-13 September 2019). 
Examples of activities include promoting quality journalism and investigative journalism for young
and mid-career journalists, a regional scheme for EU journalism awards and a technical assistance
programme for public service broadcasters. 
In partnership with UNESCO, support for media accountability, media internal governance and 
media information literacy is provided to address challenges related to disinformation in the region. 
As part of the larger EU/Council of Europe Horizontal Facility for the Western Balkans and Turkey,
the judiciary and media regulatory authorities in the region receive assistance in applying the 
European Court of Human Rights case-law system.

Within the context of shrinking civic space and authoritarian practices to restrict the freedom of the 
media in the Neighbourhood South, the EU remained committed to support independent media both
through regional and bilateral interventions. Besides bilateral support where possible (e.g. MEDIA
UP in Tunisia), a number of regional programmes supported the media, their networking and
peerto-peer capacity enhancement through hands-on production-led training for journalists and in-house
training for editors/management (regional OPEN Media Hub); engaging youth through online media, 
broadcasters, and media literacy (D-Jil and Shabab Live); engaging women in the media and
audiovisual sector, as well as in broader social/community based debate. 
The fight against disinformation remained a priority objective in 2019, with the EU institutions and 
the Member States&#8217; authorities taking sustained and coordinated actions under the EU action plan 
against disinformation to protect the Union&#8217;s democratic systems and combat disinformation, 
including in the context of the 2019 European elections.
In 2019, the Commission commenced its review of the first year of operation of the Code of 
Practice on Disinformation, a self-regulatory instrument to which the major online platforms 
(Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft) and Mozilla, as well as European and national trade 
associations from the advertising sector are subscribed.
On their side, the Strategic Communications Task Forces, set up to address communication 
challenges in the EU Neighbourhood, focused on:
- identifying disinformation to address the manipulation of public opinion, the pollution 
and polarisation of open debates and the harassment of independent voices;
- analysing the information environment, awareness-raising, local capacity building, 
promoting media literacy, and proactively positioning the EU narrative;
- engaging with civil society and journalists, in the firm belief that supporting 
independent media and working to ensure that online and offline spaces for debate are
preserved is essential to the well-being of those regions and of Europe.

The Task Force for Strategic Communication in the Eastern Neighbourhood continued to work on 
the EUvsDisinfo website22 gaining over one million page views, marked the 10th anniversary of
Eastern Partnership with the #EaP10 campaign, expanded the disinformation database to more than 
2500 cases, and continued to engage with civil society and media from the EaP countries. The 
Rapid Alert System was launched, enabling an information-sharing and analysis platform for the 
Member States.
The Western Balkans Task Force focused on reinforcing the EU narrative in the Western Balkans 
through proactive, fact-based communications, strengthening an enabling media environment in the 
region, and on strategic work on countering and building resilience to disinformation. 
The Task Force South addressed communications challenges in the Southern Neighbourhood and 
the Gulf region by communicating better, including in Arabic, about the EU and its policies to help 
address misperceptions, and by listening to target audiences. 
The role of the EU delegations in partner countries remained crucial to the EU&#8217;s action to support 
freedom of expression in the world. To reinforce the EU delegations, additional operational tools 
were prepared with the assistance of the Media4Democracy programme, such as the Access to 
Information Guide and the handbook on protecting the security of journalists. Sessions on freedom 
of expression were integrated into the training for EU delegations&#8217; human rights and gender focal 
points. A webinar on the priority areas of action for the implementation of the freedom of 
expression guidelines was tested by seven delegations in December 2019.

&#8216;Media Literacy in an age of news overabundance&#8217;: media literacy coalition in the Republic
of North Macedonia &#8211; EU-funded project
This project promoted media and information literacy, quality journalism and active citizenship. 
It was implemented by the Institute of Communication Studies with a total of EUR 280 138 EU 
funding under the Civil Society and Media Programme. As a result, more than 800 students from 
nearly 40 schools in the Republic of North Macedonia, through the high school newspaper 
&#8216;Medium&#8217;, learned how to critically consume media messages and how to produce news content. 
The project provoked a national debate among state institutions, schools and civil society about 
advancing media literacy education. 
The project further demonstrated that the media and the civil society could work together 
effectively, as partners in the first media and information literacy coalition (MAMIL) in the 
country, to promote active citizenship and the human rights of persons belonging to marginalised 
groups. Their collaborative news stories, which focused on patients suffering from rare diseases, 
made those patients more visible to the national health system and led to legislative changes. 
The European Commission recognised MAMIL as one of the 10 best media literacy projects 
during the European Media Literacy Week 2019 in Brussels.
Freedom of expression online and offline is particularly relevant during electoral processes. The EU
election observation missions pay particular attention to assessing online and offline content and to 
the use of platforms by candidates, political parties, election management bodies, civil society and 
other relevant stakeholders. They also monitor the attempts by authorities to limit access to social 
media or to the internet in general during key electoral periods. New guidelines have been 
developed for assessing online content, complying with international human rights instruments, 
commitments and good practices concerning freedom of expression and internet governance and 
regulation and, following a first pilot in Tunisia, they will be used in all EU observation missions 
from 2020 onwards.

In the dialogues with partner countries, current developments (and challenges) in Europe were
discussed and, when suitable, proposals to provide technical assistance were put forward.
In 2019, the challenges posed by new technologies led to growing concerns over violations and 
abuses of human rights online, hate speech, online defamation, internet shutdowns and the safety of 
journalists and other media workers, including in Europe. Moreover, the tools that allow the 
expression of ideas can be misused to control or distort those same opinions. Even the measures 
implemented to guarantee cyber security such as anti-defamation legislation, can be used to silence 
journalists and the broader public. Especially worrying are the attempts to influence electoral 
processes. When seeking to protect the public from internet-based threats, it remains essential to 
ensure respect for human rights, including freedom of expression. 
The EU continued to closely follow the current transformation in the media landscape, launched 
new initiatives on data protection, online disinformation, hate speech and the protection of 
whistleblowers and monitored their implementation. In October 2019, the Council adopted new EU-
wide standards proposed by the Commission to guarantee a high level of protection for 
whistleblowers who report breaches of EU law. The new rules ensure safe reporting channels as 
well as prohibit reprisals against whistleblowers, such as suspension or intimidation. 
In February 2019, the Commission publicised the results of the evaluation of the implementation of 
the Code of Conduct on hate speech agreed in 2016 with Facebook, Microsoft, YouTube, Twitter 
and other platforms. The evaluation showed that this self-regulatory tool has helped to quickly
achieve tangible results: IT companies respond to notices within 24 hours and on average they
remove 72 % of content notified to them, always respecting international human rights law,
including the freedom of expression.
In addressing hate speech, the EU appreciated the latest reports from the UN Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the freedom of opinion and expression and from the OSCE 
Representative on Freedom of the Media, which provided important contributions on hate speech 
definition and control.

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) can have a positive impact on human rights such as 
increasing the access to education and health care services around the world, including in remote 
areas, but negative impacts can also arise. The EU has built an AI strategy and a coordinated plan to 
foster a human-centric approach to AI. Due in part to the work of the High-Level Expert Group on 
Artificial Intelligence, in April 2019 the European Commission launched the Communication on 
Building Trust in Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence aiming to ensure that European values are
at the heart of creating the right environment of trust for the successful development and use of AI. 
In this Communication, the EU affirms its intention to &#8216;bring the Union&#8217;s approach to the global 
stage and build a consensus on a human-centric AI&#8217;, including &#8216;by engaging in dialogues with non-
EU countries and organising bilateral and multilateral meetings to build a consensus on
humancentric AI&#8217;. 
8. FREEDOM OF RELIGION OR BELIEF 
In 2019, freedom of religion or belief (FoRB) remained a key priority in the EU&#8217;s external human
rights policy, led by the Guidelines on the Promotion and Protection of Freedom of Religion or 
Belief.  
In the course of political dialogues with partner countries in 2019, including during more than 20 
human rights dialogues and consultations, the EU consistently raised its concerns about FoRB
violations. Concerns were raised in particular with countries of the Middle East and the North 
African region, South Asia, Central Asia and South East Asia. The EU paid particular attention to 
acts of violence and discrimination against persons based on their religion or belief. Concerns were
raised about the criminalisation of apostasy and blasphemy, as well as about legislation that hinders 
official registration for religious groups. Ahead of the human rights dialogues, the EU 
systematically consulted civil society including faith-based organisations and humanist 
organisations in order to receive information on the most extreme human rights violations 
(including FoRB violations) in third countries.

The EU reacted publicly to condemn attacks on religious grounds in 2019. Accordingly, the HR/VP 
issued statements after the attacks on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, and on churches in 
Sri Lanka. Other statements were published, condemning the persecution of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses in 
Russia or showing support for the case of Asia Bibi in Pakistan. A statement was also issued on the 
occasion of the first International Day Commemorating the Victims of Acts of Violence Based on 
Religion or Belief on 22 August. 
The EU remained a strong FoRB advocate in multilateral fora. The EU was the lead sponsor of a 
FoRB resolution both in the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly Third 
Committee. The FoRB resolution urged states to protect, respect and fulfil the right to freedom of
religion or belief, while expressing concerns for violations to the right to FoRB, and calling on 
states to step up their efforts to implement the commitments undertaken. In March 2019, the 
resolution renewed the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur for the period 2019-2021. The EU 
continued to work closely with the OIC on the resolution on &#8216;combating intolerance, negative 
stereotyping and stigmatisation of, and discrimination, incitement to violence and violence against, 
persons based on religion or belief&#8217;, to ensure the complementarity of the two resolutions and 
universal ownership. 
In addition, the EU was active during the HRC session in March in raising the profile and the 
importance of the right to FoRB and the visibility of EU action: it organised a side event with the 
UN Special Rapporteur (UNSR) on FoRB, focusing on his latest report: &#8216;Two sides of the same 
coin: The Interdependence of Freedom of Religion or Belief and Freedom of Expression&#8217;. The 
UNSR highlighted that states&#8217; obligations to restrict hate speech must meet the threshold defined by
international human rights law. 
The EU maintained an excellent cooperation with the mandate of the UNSR, by regularly
exchanging information on mutual priorities at meetings with EEAS officials and EU Member
States in Brussels and in EU delegations. In September 2019, the EU was invited to participate in a 
workshop in Geneva on reconciling the right to non-discrimination and religious freedom. The 
workshop was part of the work of the rapporteur on the intersection between the right to freedom of 
religion or belief and gender equality.

In April 2019, the EU hosted a &#8216;stock-taking exercise&#8217; as part of the Istanbul Process, in cooperation 
with Denmark and the Universal Rights Group think-tank. The event provided the opportunity to 
consider the status of the Istanbul Process and to reflect on the lessons learnt. Following the event, 
the Netherlands announced its intention to host the next formal meeting of the Istanbul Process in 
The Hague. The conference took place on 18-19 November 2019 and presented the opportunity to 
renew the EU&#8217;s commitment to tackle emerging forms of religious intolerance and violence, 
discrimination and hatred. It also allowed the EU to further disseminate information on the efforts 
and actions undertaken at EU and national levels to tackle these phenomena, including on fighting
hate speech online. 
FoRB also remained high on the EU&#8217;s agenda in the course of 2019 in New York. The annual 
resolution was once more adopted by consensus in the Third Committee and the General Assembly, 
confirming the strong support of UN members for the EU&#8217;s work in this area. The interactive 
dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on FoRB, where he presented his most recent report focusing
on antisemitism, provided the opportunity to highlight the December 2018 declaration of the 
Council of the EU on the fight against antisemitism, to elaborate on some of the key measures taken 
at EU level following the adoption of the declaration, such as in the field of training and education,
as well as to reiterate the EU&#8217;s strong support for the work of the UNSR. In June 2019, the EU was 
instrumental in the organisation of a high-level event on antisemitism, jointly organised with Israel, 
Canada and the US. The year also marked a series of important meetings held at the UN&#8217;s 
headquarters on the UN&#8217;s action plans related to FoRB: the Fez action plan, addressed mainly to 
religious leaders to help prevent atrocity crimes; the Plan of Action to Safeguard Religious Sites; 
and the Plan of Action on Hate Speech. At several high-level meetings held to assess the progress of
implementation of these action plans, the EU made relevant contributions in a number of fields.

At OSCE level, the EU engaged constructively in the negotiations on a draft decision put forward 
by the Slovak chair on &#8216;enhancing efforts to combat intolerance and discrimination against 
Christians, Jews, Muslims and members of other religions or beliefs&#8217; for the Bratislava OSCE 
Ministerial Council, in line with the EU&#8217;s well-established comprehensive approach to all forms of 
discrimination and intolerance, and the existing EU Guidelines on FoRB, and proposing
amendments to strengthen the references to FoRB in the text. At the first OSCE Supplementary
Human Dimension Meeting dedicated to upholding the principles of tolerance and
nondiscrimination, including in the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief, the 
Special Envoy for Promotion of Freedom of Religion or Belief outside the EU, J&#225;n Figel, presented 
the EU&#8217;s legal framework, internal and external policy and actions. The EU actively participated in
the discussions on FoRB during the annual OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting
(HDIM) in Warsaw and in the Human Dimension Committee. On several occasions, the EU also 
raised the situation of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses in the Russian Federation, both in the OSCE Permanent 
Council and at the HDIM. 
On 6 September, HR/VP Mogherini launched the Global Exchange on Religion in Society at a
wellattended international conference in Brussels with participants from diverse backgrounds, including 
human rights defenders, institutional faith actors and government representatives. The Global 
Exchange on Religion in Society will connect civil society practitioners inside and outside Europe, 
allowing them to learn from each other, explore partnerships, acquire new skills, and to scale up 
positive experiences of coexistence among people of different faiths in pluralistic societies. 
Launching the initiative, Federica Mogherini explained: &#8220;It is a kind of Erasmus for civil society
actors and activists who are working on faith and social inclusion&#8221;. The future exchange will bring
together groups of 20 to 25 people working on the same issues: they will travel to a place with 
special relevance to the issue at stake, visit local NGOs and institutions, and in the meantime, share 
their own experience and learn from other participants. They will also take part in workshops to 
learn specific skills such as project design or social media campaigning. After the end of each 
exchange, a virtual follow-up will take place.

In the course of 2019, the EEAS organised several training courses on FoRB-related issues at its 
headquarters as well as in the field. In her guidance on taking forward the interface between religion
and foreign policy, the EEAS Secretary-General highlighted the need for senior officials to be better 
equipped when navigating the politico-religious landscape and to make the most of the potential of 
partnerships in pursuit of the EU&#8217;s policy objectives.
On the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on 21 March, a pilot training
was conducted for EU officials and EU Member States&#8217; diplomats, focusing on the impact of bias 
and discrimination in the field of foreign policy. In June, the EEAS organised a two-day training on 
improving the delivery of FoRB policy. Conducted by human rights practitioners, it focused on the 
challenges of advocating FoRB for all, on initiatives in the multilateral fora to promote this right 
and to guard against its polarisation. In October, the EEAS conducted its annual training on political
Islam and Islam in politics with a focus on the situation in the Gulf region and the way in which 
&#8216;Islam&#8217; is used as a political currency in the stand-off between some of the key countries in the 
region.  
The Special Envoy for the Promotion of Freedom of Religion or Belief outside the European Union,
J&#225;n Figel, continued to promote FoRB and highlight its interdependence with other human rights. 
In 2019, the Special Envoy visited Israel, Palestine, India, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrein, 
bringing to 18 the number of his official visits since his appointment in May 2016. During his 
missions, authorities, government officials, and religious leaders demonstrated their readiness to 
engage in dialogue with the EU on the policies and the legal framework related to FoRB, and 
offered opportunities to engage with religious and civil society actors. The Special Envoy continued
to support initiatives in the area of interreligious dialogue and synergies between FoRB, education
and cultural activities.

Special Envoy J&#225;n Figel met and established good cooperation with the UN High Commissioner for
Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, including on the UN-led Faith4rights23 initiative, which focuses 
on the role of religious leaders as important human rights actors and expands their responsibility to 
fight against incitement to hatred, which was already identified in the Rabat Plan of Action. 
In October 2019, an event &#8216;How to scale up EU support to FoRB&#8217; was organised by the 
Commission in Brussels, where the Special Envoy presented his final report24 to around 100 
participants, including Member States, civil society and experts, putting forward five
actionoriented recommendations.
Following a first call for proposals on intercultural dialogue in 2017, the Development Cooperation 
Instrument &#8211; Global Public Goods and Challenges (DCI-GPGC) continues to finance three regional 
projects in the Middle East and Africa with more than EUR 5 million for the period from 2018 to 
2022. The projects aim to enhance cultural pluralism and intercultural understanding related to 
religion or belief. Thereby, they will contribute to strengthening understanding, tolerance and 
respect for cultural and religious diversity.
As a result of the dedicated 2017 global call for proposals on freedom of religion or belief under the 
EIDHR, six civil society projects are being implemented. The final EU contribution is EUR 5.18 
million. The projects address key strategic areas of the 2013 EU guidelines, including the fight 
against different forms of discrimination and violence on grounds of religion or belief. 
The European Commission continued to support awareness raising, staff training and outreach 
through the learning space/concept entitled &#8216;Agora on religion and development&#8217;. In 2019, the 
Commission organised the event &#8216;HUDIRE: Human Dignity &amp; Religion - Valuing rights through
religious studies, religious hermeneutics and religious history&#8217;, bringing together around 60 eminent 
scholars and religious leaders from all over the world. Expert meetings were also held on how to 
boost FoRB literacy with academics and CSOs.

9. TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Whilst the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is 
absolute in international law, it continued to be challenged all over the world in 2019.
The EU stepped up its efforts towards a torture-free world, notably by updating the Guidelines on 
EU Policy towards Third Countries on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment, adopted by the Council, together with Council conclusions, on 16 September 2019.
In 2019, this third revision of the guidelines reflected policy developments both at global and EU
level, notably the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the revised UN Standard Minimum 
Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, the Global Strategy for the EU&#8217;s Foreign and Security Policy
and the Global Alliance for Torture-Free Trade25. The guidelines include references to important 
issues such as enforced disappearances, sexual and gender-based violence and victims&#8217; rights and 
provide a non-exhaustive list of contexts where torture may occur. They also highlight the relevance 
of procedural safeguards (in particular in the first hours of detention) and the key role played by
monitoring mechanisms in the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment. With this update, the EU renews its firm commitment to combat torture
worldwide through a comprehensive approach encompassing prohibition, prevention, accountability
and redress for the victims.
HR/VP Mogherini issued a declaration on behalf of the EU on the occasion of the International Day
in Support of Victims of Torture (26 June 2019), reaffirming the EU&#8217;s strong opposition to any kind 
of acts of torture worldwide. The HR/VP recalled that torture is a crime that can target anyone in 
different forms and in different settings. The HR/VP stressed the importance of continuously
engaging with our partners, at international, regional and bilateral level, along with civil society, in 
order to make progress towards the eradication of torture in all its forms. 
The EUSR for Human Rights further contributed to the fight against torture, by publicly raising the 
issue during his visits around the world, as well as in bilateral conversations with other leaders.

The EU continued to make use of all political and financial tools at its disposal, including
d&#233;marches and statements to address urgent situations.
In most human rights dialogues, the EU raised torture and/or other ill-treatment, in particular urging
countries to ratify and fully implement the Convention against Torture and its Optional Protocol; 
fully align their legislation with the Convention; comply with recommendations from monitoring
mechanisms; and ensure that all reports of torture and other ill-treatment are properly and 
impartially investigated, perpetrators are brought to justice, and victims are afforded redress. 
During these dialogues, the EU offered concrete assistance to countries in their efforts to eradicate 
torture and ill-treatment depending on their needs, including financial support. 
The EU also continued to promote judiciary reform in several countries, aiming to secure an 
independent justice sector, access to justice and improved prison conditions both through political 
dialogue and financial support. 
Torture was also high on the agenda of the Seventh World Congress against the Death Penalty26 , 
held in Brussels from 26 February to 1 March 2019, in plenary discussions and side-events. 
At multilateral level, the biennial UN resolution on &#8216;Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment&#8217;, introduced by Denmark, was adopted without a vote on 18 December 
2019.

Inspired by the so-called EU &#8217;Anti-Torture&#8217; Regulation27, the Global Alliance for Torture-Free 
Trade, a cross-regional effort bringing together more than 60 countries committed to ending trade in 
goods used for torture and capital punishment globally was carried forward throughout the year. On
28 June 2019, the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 73/304 on &#8216;Torture-Free Trade: 
examining the feasibility, scope and parameters for possible common international standards&#8217; with 
81 votes in favour. This resolution paves the way for future work at UN level towards establishing
common international standards in this field, starting with a report on the subject that was submitted 
by the UN Secretary-General to the UNGA during its 74th session in September 2019.
The EU continued to support projects worldwide aiming at the eradication of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. As part of the EIDHR, 10 projects were
contracted in 2019, for a total amount of EUR 3.6 million, and by the end of 2019 a total of 59 
torture-related projects, worth EUR 31.9 million, were ongoing. A large number of projects were
tailored to country needs through the country-based support schemes implemented at local level.
The EIDHR focused on the fight against torture in a holistic way, supporting actions on prohibition, 
prevention, accountability and rehabilitation. For example, in Uganda, the EU supported the 
Accountability for Torture and Rights&#8217; Enhancement project, which provides holistic rehabilitation 
services to torture survivors with specific emphasis on women, children and the elderly. In addition 
to rehabilitation, the project focuses on advocating for the prevention of torture, seeking
accountability to hold perpetrators to account for their actions, and restoring the survivors&#8217; rights to 
remedy and reparations. In Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa, a multi-country project financed by
EIDHR focuses on establishing effective controls on the use and trade in torture technologies as a 
way to fight torture and prevent the misuse of tools in law enforcement. 
Regulation (EU) 2019/125 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 January 2019 
concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (codification). It repeals Council 
Regulation (EC) 1236/2005 and its successive amendments.

The EIDHR global call for proposals issued on 25 November 2019 included a lot aiming to provide 
overall support of EUR 8 million to civil society projects contributing to the prohibition and 
prevention of torture and ensuring accountability for acts of torture and ill-treatment. New to the 
2019 call is a regional focus, allowing applicants to propose projects in one to three countries in the 
same region, and the possibility of CSOs working together with NHRIs and National Preventive 
Mechanisms to improve synergies.
Tunisia &#8211; Protecting the rights of detainees
Two innovative and complementary works were presented to the public and the media on 
International Human Rights Day on 10 December 2019: a manual on the Tunisian prison system 
and a handbook for prisoners in Tunisia. The Justice Minister stated that, &#8216;these handbooks aim to 
uphold the rule of law and institutions by giving a human character to the prison system, to 
preserve the dignity of detainees and to promote their post-incarceration reintegration&#8217;.
These documents are the result of a year of close cooperation between the Ministry of Justice and 
the Directorate General of Prisons and Rehabilitation on the one hand, and the National Authority
for the Prevention of Torture on the other. The two books, both published in Arabic and French, 
aim to accompany detainees throughout their entire journey through the system, from the first day
in prison to the last. It explains 255 detention-related issues in an educational format of questions 
and answers. The books are primarily intended for prisoners and their families, as well as staff
working in prisons, legal professionals and civil society. The handbook will be presented and 
distributed to all 23 000 prisoners and 7 000 staff in the country&#8217;s 27 prisons. 
The preparation of these books is part of the Support Project for Independent Authorities in 
Tunisia (PAII-T, 2019-2021), co-funded by the EU and the CoE.

10. THE DEATH PENALTY
In 2019, working towards the global abolition of the death penalty remained at the heart of the EU&#8217;s
human rights priorities. Throughout the year, the EU continued to voice its strong opposition to the 
death penalty, which is a cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, violating the right to life and 
failing to deter crime any more effectively than imprisonment. Execution is an irreversible 
punishment and miscarriages of justice, inevitable in any legal system, lead to the killing of 
innocent people by state authorities. 
More than half a century after the adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the trend
towards the worldwide abolition of the death penalty is evident. While in 1960, only 25 countries 
were abolitionist, today three quarters of the world&#8217;s countries (145 at the end of 2019) have
abolished the death penalty in law or in practice, and this number continues to grow. 
In 2019, the United States served as a good example of the continuous progress towards abolition: 
 New Hampshire became the 21st abolitionist state in law in the US;
 Governor Newsom declared a moratorium on executions in California, the state with the 
most death row inmates in the US;
 Indiana reached 10 years without executions, bringing the number of US states without 
executions for ten or more years to 32 out of a total of 50. 
Moreover, in 2019, Angola became party to the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which deals with the abolition of the death 
penalty, and Armenia signed the same protocol. 
The year 2019 was also marked by the unsuccessful call for reintroduction of the death penalty in 
the Philippines and a failed attempt to resume executions in the US at federal level, where a de facto 
moratorium on executions prevails since 2003.

The EU consistently raised the issue of capital punishment with third countries that still use it, and 
this topic featured on the agendas of EU political dialogues or dedicated human rights dialogues. 
Based on the minimum standards defined by international law and the EU Guidelines on the Death 
Penalty, the EU issued a number of public statements deploring the use of the death penalty, and 
called on those countries to consider a moratorium. This was notably the case for Belarus, Iran, 
Japan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the US, with additional statements issued and d&#233;marches 
carried out in other countries. The EU has put considerable emphasis on condemning the violation 
of minimum standards, stressing the inadmissibility of the use of the death penalty for minors, for 
persons with intellectual disabilities, and for crimes that do not count among the &#8216;most serious&#8217;, 
such as drug offences. 
The EU continued to raise its opposition to the death penalty in all relevant multilateral fora, in 
particular at the UN, the OSCE and the Council of Europe. The Global Alliance for Torture-Free 
Trade also takes measures to control and restrict trade in death penalty instruments. 
To mark the European Day against the Death Penalty and the World Day against the Death Penalty
on 10 October 2019, the EU and the Council of Europe issued a joint statement reaffirming their 
opposition to the use of capital punishment in all circumstances, and their commitment to the 
abolition of the death penalty worldwide. Numerous EU delegations marked this significant date by
organising debates, publishing op-eds, and conducting other public awareness activities.
Belarus is the only country in Europe and Central Asia that still applies the death penalty. The EU 
actively engaged with the Belarusian authorities on the death penalty and took action to raise 
awareness.

The abolition of the death penalty is one of the thematic priorities for assistance under the EIDHR. 
This funding is mainly channelled through CSOs worldwide, with a focus on local civil society and
contributing, inter alia, to the training of the judiciary and legal professionals, awareness raising
among the general public, the creation of national networks, the monitoring of the use of the death 
penalty and of the application of international minimum standards, advocacy efforts for legal reform 
and dialogue on specific issues such as counter-terrorism and the fight against drugs. The 2018 
EIDHR global call for proposals allocated EUR 8.1 million for projects supporting civil society
activities with a view to the universal abolition of the death penalty. This enabled six new projects 
covering Niger, the Philippines, Taiwan, Uganda, the US, Cameroon, DRC, Indonesia, Malaysia, 
Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, China and
India to start in 2019. 
Sponsored by the EU, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway and Australia, the Seventh World Congress 
Against the Death Penalty took place in Brussels from 26 February to 1 March 2019. A major 
triennial abolitionist event, it brought together over 1 500 public and private actors involved in the 
cause of the abolition of the death penalty around the world. 
11. EQUALITY AND ANTI-DISCRIMINATION
On 18 March 2019, the Council adopted conclusions approving the EU Human Rights Guidelines 
on Non-discrimination in External Action28. The Human Rights Guidelines on Non-discrimination 
provide conceptual and operational guidance for the EU&#8217;s human rights policy in external action. 
They also deliver on the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy, complement and 
reinforce all other EU human rights guidelines, and support the EU&#8217;s rights-based approach to 
development cooperation encompassing all human rights.

Gender Equality and Girls&#8217; and Women&#8217;s Empowerment 
The 25th anniversary of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and
Development and the 40th anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 2019 provided great impetus for continuing 
to translate the EU&#8217;s legal and policy frameworks into reality for all women and girls, and for the 
good of all. The EU&#8217;s internal and external policy and actions are interlinked to ensure that progress 
towards gender equality is made in a coherent, consistent and effective way both within and outside 
the EU. 
In 2019, the EU continued to be at the forefront of action to achieve gender equality, to ensure the 
full enjoyment of all human rights by all girls and women, and to empower them. EU action
focused on the following areas of intervention: (i) ensuring girls&#8217; and women&#8217;s physical and 
psychological integrity; (ii) promoting women&#8217;s economic empowerment; (iii) strengthening
women&#8217;s participation in politics and public life and leadership; (iv) achieving and sustaining peace 
through the inclusive and meaningful participation of women in all matters related to security and 
all phases of peace processes.
The EU remains committed to the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all human rights and to 
the full and effective implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and the Programme of 
Action on the International Conference on Population and Development and the outcomes of their 
review conferences and remains committed to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), in 
this context. Having that in mind, the EU reaffirms its commitment to the promotion, protection and 
fulfilment of the right of every individual to have full control over, and decide freely and 
responsibly on matters related to their sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from 
discrimination, coercion and violence. The EU further stresses the need for universal access to 
quality and affordable comprehensive sexual and reproductive health information, education, 
including comprehensive sexuality education and health-care services.

The EU renewed its commitment to gender equality and girls&#8217; and women&#8217;s empowerment, and 
demonstrated greater skill and flexibility in tailoring its strategy to its interlocutors, while serving
and preserving its values and interests. The EU continued to engage with a broad range of actors, 
including partner countries, international and regional organisations, and civil society, to achieve 
gender equality worldwide. 
The EU&#8217;s commitment to gender equality was demonstrated through a variety of undertakings, in 
particular through engaging in political and policy dialogues with partner countries and regional 
organisations, notably the AU and ASEAN, assuming a higher profile in international
decisionmaking fora, developing joint initiatives, and endorsing gender mainstreaming as a key strategy for
achieving gender equality, to mention just a few. 
Gender equality, girls&#8217; and women&#8217;s empowerment and the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) 
agenda have been a major point for discussion with partner countries and regional organisations 
during all political and human rights dialogues and sub-committees, informal working groups and 
consultations. Overall, these exchanges were held in a cooperative and constructive spirit, by
sharing knowledge and best practices, and identifying concrete joint actions and deliverables.
Over the year, the EU successfully balanced bilateral and multilateral approaches to the gender 
equality agenda. Furthermore, the EU successfully defended global commitments to gender equality
and positioned itself against any unilateral action or proposal aimed at undermining the 
international gender equality acquis. The 63rd session of the Commission on the Status of Women, 
sessions of the UN Human Rights Council, in particular the June session, and the annual session of 
the UN General Assembly Third Committee confirmed that the EU is a reliable, cooperative and 
principled global player on gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment. 
Enhanced partnership and operational cooperation with regional organisations, such as the OSCE, 
the CoE, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the AU, the Organisation of American 
States (OAS), the ASEAN, the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), the ICRC and the OIC, as well 
as with the G7 and G20 framework, accelerated progress towards achieving gender equality for all. 
The EU successfully acted as a driving force, a strong promoter and a balancing force among other 
major powers, while defending internationally recognised gender equality principles and standards.

Over the year, the EU continued to forge a significant number of gender-focused and gender-related
initiatives. These initiatives stood out for the number of women and girls who are benefiting from 
them worldwide, including in the most remote and marginalised areas, the meaningful role played
by civil society organisations and women human rights defenders in their implementation, and for 
the size of the EU&#8217;s financial investment. These initiatives are part and parcel of the overall EU 
contribution to implementing the 2030 Agenda and achieving the entire set of Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs).
Through the Partnership Instrument, the EU has spearheaded initiatives to promote women&#8217;s 
economic empowerment through responsible business conduct in G7 countries and European
business links with Latin American women-led enterprises, companies and networks as well as 
women as economic actors and leaders in Asia. These initiatives are ongoing with an EU
contribution of EUR 22.5 million, and are conducted in coordination and partnership with UN 
Women and ILO.
The report on the implementation of the EU Gender Action Plan II in EU external action29, which 
was endorsed by the Council conclusions of 25 November 2019, included detailed information on 
the initiatives taken by all EU services with external mandates, 133 EU delegations to partner 
countries and the EU Member States. In particular, the Council reaffirmed the EU&#8217;s and Member 
States&#8217; full and unwavering commitment to achieving the 17 SDGs by 2030, including to promoting

Supporting the Economic Empowerment of Afghan Women through Education and 
Training in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan 
On 12 November, the trilateral project &#8216;Supporting the Economic Empowerment of Afghan 
Women through Education and Training in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan&#8217;, an initiative of the 
Kazakh Government, was launched in Brussels. The EU has contributed EUR 2 million to this 
project, the first example of trilateral cooperation between Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, 
Afghanistan and the European Union. The project will enable 50 Afghan women to complete 
undergraduate, postgraduate and technical courses in agriculture, statistics and mining at 
academic establishments across Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. It also brings together three key
interconnected priorities: women&#8217;s empowerment and gender equality; the role of education in 
generating knowledge and growth; and the promotion of regional stability and peace-building
through regional connectivity.
In 2019, the EU continued to lead the global fight against all forms of sexual and gender-based 
violence, including intimate partner violence, domestic violence, harmful practices such as female 
genital mutilation and child, early and forced marriage, so-called honour-related violence and
killings, as well as conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence, sexual exploitation, abuse and 
harassment, trafficking of women and girls mostly for the purpose of sexual exploitation, 
online/cyber violence and bullying. The EU engaged on multiple fronts: reinforcing the legal 
framework, developing comprehensive and integrated policies for its implementation, introducing
practical measures in this respect and allocating gender-responsive resources.  
Over the year, the EU made further significant strides towards acceding to the Council of Europe&#8217;s 
Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, known
as the Istanbul Convention. By acceding to the Convention, the European legal framework would be 
strengthened with a set of legally binding standards for greater protection and support to ensure a 
life free from violence, including domestic violence for all women.

As per Article 6 of the CEDAW, the EU recognises trafficking of women and girls for the purpose 
of sexual exploitation as violence against women. Globally, the EU continued to uphold the 
standards and principles of United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime 
(UNTOC) and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially
Women and Children as the primary international legal instruments to prevent and address the 
crime.
The gender-specific approach to addressing trafficking in human beings in line with the 2017 
Communication contributed to stepping up EU anti-trafficking action. The horizontal mandate of 
the EU Anti-trafficking Coordinator contributed to making good progress in this regard. Findings of
the European Commission&#8217;s second report on the progress made in the fight against trafficking in 
human beings (2018), and the study on EU wide data collection, indicated that women and girls are 
the vast majority of the victims overall, and mainly trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation,
including within national borders. Trafficking continued to be systematically addressed in key
policy instruments such as the EU Action Plan on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment 
and the EU Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality, and backed-up by adequate funding. The 
EU has aligned its development cooperation to Agenda 2030, which addresses trafficking in human 
beings under three targets. One of them (SDG 5.2) concerns trafficking of women and girls for 
sexual exploitation. Specific measures on trafficking of women and girls are included under the EU-
UN Spotlight initiative.

The EU&#8217;s enlargement and neighbourhood policy also contributed to the promotion and 
implementation of the Istanbul Convention, with a focus on preventing violence against women,
tackling gender stereotyping, and changing gender norms across the region. Specific collaboration 
with the CoE is taking place in the Southern Mediterranean region through the different phases of 
the South Programme (South Programme IV, 2020-2022). This collaboration resulted in Tunisia 
officially requesting to become a contracting party to the Istanbul Convention in September 2019, 
and in the adoption of legislation on domestic violence by Tunisia (2017) and Morocco (2018). In
addition, programmes in the Western Balkans and Turkey (EU-UN programme &#8216;Ending violence 
against women phase II&#8217;, lasting until 2022 with a total of EUR 2.5 million) and the Eastern 
Partnership (new regional EU-UNFPA/UN WOMEN programme &#8216;EU4GenderEquality: 
Challenging gender stereotypes and practices&#8217;, lasting until 2023 with a total of EUR 9 million) 
engaged both international and civil society organisations in tackling gender-based violence against 
women and girls from a multi-pronged approach.
The EU also made progress on the implementation of the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative to eliminate 
violence against women and girls worldwide, which, in 2019, saw EUR 133.7 million committed to 
programmes in the Caribbean (EUR 42 million), Central Asia (Tajikistan &#8211; EUR 6 million and 
Kyrgyzstan &#8211; EUR 6 million), the Pacific (EUR 50 million) and the Sub-Saharan African region 
(EUR 30 million). In terms of results, the Spotlight Initiative is contributing to: 
 fostering a new generation of responsible digital citizens in Argentina through education 
on sexual abuse and violence; 
 the empowerment of young people to lead on local decisions in El Salvador; 
 the adoption of new legislation to end violence against women and commitments from 
religious leaders on harmful practices in Liberia; 
 the engagement of more than 1 000 faith-based women leaders and influencers via a 
partnership with the Seventh Day Adventist Church &#8216;End It Now&#8217; campaign in Malawi; 
 access to fistula repairs for 150 women and girls living with obstetric fistula in Nigeria;
 access to refugee settlements and to mental health, psychosocial wellbeing and justice 
services for more than 500 gender-based violence survivors in Uganda.

At the G7 Biarritz Summit in August 2019, the EU announced a EUR 85 million contribution to 
Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa (AFAWA), an initiative led by the African 
Development Bank (AfDB) that aims to bridge the finance gap for women in Africa and release 
their entrepreneurial capacity and potential. The EU is partnering with KfW Development Bank and 
Women&#8217;s World Banking on a blending project called the Women&#8217;s Financial Inclusion Facility, 
which promotes women&#8217;s economic empowerment and financial inclusion in Sub-Saharan 
countries. In 2019, the EU&#8217;s first contribution of EUR 10 million showed significant first results,
playing an important catalytic role and helping to bring in other investors to contribute to the fund. 
Furthermore, in the framework of the Digital2Equal initiative for online platforms engaged in 
improving opportunities for women, Airbnb announced in February 2019 a partnership with the 
Digital Empowerment Foundation to deliver hospitality skills training to 15 000 women in India to 
support women&#8217;s economic empowerment.
During 2018 and 2019, the EU allocated approximately EUR 52 million in humanitarian aid to 
preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). In May 2019, 
Commissioner Stylianides represented the EU at an international conference on sexual and
genderbased violence in Oslo. At the conference, he reiterated the EU&#8217;s commitment to preventing and 
responding to SGBV and showcased EU actions in this field. Throughout the year, the EU also 
continued to be an active member of the global initiative Call to Action on Protection from Gender-
Based Violence in Emergencies, and an EU-supported project that was started during the EU&#8217;s 
leadership of Call to Action culminated in the development of inter-agency standards on
genderbased violence in emergencies and guidance on how to develop context-specific Call to Action 
Road Maps (from pilot projects in Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo). This project 
was implemented by UNFPA, the Gender-Based Violence Area of Responsibility and the Women&#8217;s
Refugee Commission. In December 2019, the EU launched its first ever e-learning module on the 
European Commission&#8217;s Gender-Age Marker tool for humanitarian action.

&#8216;16 days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence&#8217; &#8211; campaign in Nigeria
In 2019, the EU delegation launched the &#8216;16 days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence&#8217;
campaign. From 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against 
Women, to 10 December, the International Human Rights Day, the EU delegation and Member
States galvanised action to end violence against women and girls in Nigeria. The EU supported the 
creation of 15 sexual assault referral centres across the country through its Rule of Law and Anti-
Corruption programme, implemented by the British Council.
The Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda has been established as an area of increasing
cooperation with partners. The full implementation of the WPS agenda remained a priority for the 
EU. The EU now has a robust policy framework in place, with the 2018 Council conclusions on 
WPS endorsing the EU Strategic Approach to WPS and its action plan (July 2019). Based on the 
EU Strategic Approach to WPS, the EU action plan on WPS identifies objectives already defined in
the WPS agenda in the key priority areas of prevention, protection, relief and recovery, and the 
three overarching and crosscutting principles of participation, gender mainstreaming and leading by
example. All these objectives are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. This new policy framework 
further enhances the EU&#8217;s leading role in the promotion of effective multilateralism and gender
equality and women&#8217;s empowerment, and the WPS agenda also assists the efforts of the UN and the 
broader global community to speed up the implementation of UNSC Resolution 1325 and its 
follow-up resolutions on WPS.

In August 2019 at the G7 Biarritz Summit, and in the margins of the UNGA in September 2019, the 
EU announced its strong support to the Initiative for Survivors of Conflict-Related Sexual Violence.
The EU committed to allocating EUR 2 million within its 2020 budget to support the establishment 
of an international reparations system for conflict-related sexual violence.
In 2018, the G7 Foreign Ministers agreed on the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Partnerships 
Initiative and the EU identified Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) as its partner to work on the 
implementation of UNSCR 1325. In 2019, a joint EU-BiH Roadmap (2019-2022) was approved. In 
addition, collaboration with the League of Arab States (El-Hiwar Programme) and the UfM also 
targeted the effective implementation of UNSCR 1325 in the Southern Neighbourhood region and 
the potential development of a regional action plan on WPS. The EU worked closely with women&#8217;s 
civil society organisations, through both advocacy and programming (Combating Violence against 
Women in the Southern Neighbourhood Region, 2019-2021) to ensure monitoring and 
implementation of UNSCR 1325 in the region.
The WPS agenda is one of the priorities for 2019-2021 on peace operations and crisis management 
in the EU-UN strategic partnership. It is also one of the priorities of the cooperation with NATO 
and the OSCE and is increasingly included in political dialogues with partners and third countries.
The EEAS Principal Advisor on Gender/UNSCR 1325 participated in a series of human rights 
dialogues held in Brussels (notably with Brazil, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, ASEAN, UN and Mexico).

Facilitating access to justice for victims of femicide through the collaboration between civil 
society and local authorities on the implementation of the Supreme Court sentence in the 
case of Mariana Lima in Mexico
With the support of the European Commission, this project was implemented by Catolicas por el 
Derecho a Decidir (CDD) and the National Citizen&#8217;s Observatory on Femicide (OCNF). Mariana&#8217;s 
case is representative of many other cases in Mexico of honour-related violence and femicide. 
Such cases start with an uphill battle against scepticism, negligence and outright obstruction by
authorities during the investigation, followed by a judicial process that, more often than not, 
continues to re-victimise the victims and their families. The project aims to contribute to the 
incorporation of the recommendations of the Supreme Court in Mariana Lima&#8217;s case in criminal 
investigations of femicide. The premise is that all violent deaths of women should be investigated 
as femicide until proven otherwise. This also makes it imperative that investigation protocols are 
guided by the highest standards of due diligence from a gender perspective. Thanks to this project, 
the femicide investigation protocols of two Mexican states have been modified and published, and 
it is expected that the protocols of a further five states will be modified over the coming months. 
As part of the project, CDD and the OCNF are also helping family members in over 50 femicide
cases to gain access to justice. Throughout 2019, several cases saw progress. Among the most 
emblematic achievements was the case of Lesvy Berlin Osorio, whose death in 2017 was ruled a 
suicide amidst judicial irregularities and stigmatising attitudes from authorities. The case was 
reclassified as femicide and went to trial in accordance with the criteria stemming from Mariana 
Lima&#8217;s case. In 2019, the authorities offered a public apology for how they handled Lesvy&#8217;s case 
and the perpetrator was finally sentenced to 45 years in prison. The accompaniment of femicide 
cases is therefore not only positive for the cases themselves, but also helps to document and shed 
light on grave violations, such as inconsistent investigations, corruption and impunity, and to 
pressure authorities to improve how they perform their duties.

The EU&#8217;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions and operations continued to 
reinforce their work on gender and human rights mainstreaming, guided by the overall EU policies 
on, inter alia, WPS and gender equality, and the recommendations of the Baseline Study on the 
Integration of Human Rights and Gender into CSDP (2016). In 2019, progress was made in various
areas, including sourcing and improving gender statistics. At the end of 2019, all civilian CSDP 
missions had at least one full-time human rights and gender adviser, as well as a functioning gender 
focal point (GFP) system. The number of gender adviser positions in military missions also 
increased.  
WPS plays a prominent role in EU partnerships, including the EU-UN strategic partnership on 
peace operations and crisis management, in which it is one of eight priorities for 2019-2021. A joint 
EU-UN Workshop in Brussels collected lessons learned and good practices as regards exploring
ways to promote women&#8217;s meaningful participation in peace operations and processes and crisis 
management. The EU and the UN conducted a joint mapping exercise reviewing the cooperation 
between UN peace operations and EU CSDP missions and operations on WPS. The outcomes of the 
mapping will form a basis for further developing cooperation in the field.
During 2019, the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) began the implementation of 
Council Decision (CFSP) 2018/2011 in support of gender mainstreamed policies, programmes and 
actions in the fight against small arms trafficking and misuse, in line with the WPS agenda. The 
overall objective of this project is to contribute to international peace, security, gender equality and 
sustainable development by enhancing the effectiveness of small arms control measures. This is to 
be achieved through the promotion of systematic gender-analysis-based approaches and the 
integration of gender perspectives, thereby leading to enhanced security and safety for women and 
girls. The project&#8217;s progress was presented at a side event on 25 October in the margins of the 
UNGA First Committee in New York.

Rights of the Child 
The year 2019 marked the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), 
which is the most widely ratified human rights treaty. This gave the EU an opportunity to reaffirm 
its commitment to protect and promote the rights of the child and to engage with children on 
matters that affect them. The statement by the HR/VP and the European Commission on Universal 
Children&#8217;s Day reconfirmed this commitment. To empower children to speak up and to express 
their views on their own rights, the EU and UNICEF launched a global campaign called 
#TheRealChallenge30 to convey the message that the rights of the child are universal, yet they
cannot be taken for granted. Millions of users shared or viewed the campaign, helping to amplify
the message: in total it had approximately 360 million views. The campaign was announced at the 
high-level event at the UN General Assembly in September by HR/VP Mogherini.31 The EU also 
engaged with children during the European Development Days through a debate on meaningful 
child participation that was organised in cooperation with a number of NGOs and UNICEF32 . The 
panel, composed of young leaders from South Africa, Ghana, Brazil and Zambia and policymakers,
demonstrated how increased involvement of children in matters that concern them could contribute 
to reducing inequalities. In April, the EU organised the 12th European Forum on the Rights of the 
Child to assess the progress made in the EU in mainstreaming the rights of the child across EU 
policies and actions and to discuss priority areas for the future. The Forum focused on three themes: 
the protection of children in migration, children&#8217;s rights in the digital world, and children&#8217;s 
meaningful participation in policy-making.

The EU continued to implement the Guidelines on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the 
Child33 in external action. The EU offered full-day training courses to colleagues posted in the EU
delegations on the rights of the child. In addition, EU delegations received practical guidance on 
strengthening child protection systems with the aim of assisting colleagues in identifying ways to
strengthen child protection systems in countries of operation. Rights of the child were raised during
human rights dialogues with Afghanistan, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belize, China, Colombia, 
Moldova, Mongolia, Indonesia and Qatar, among others. The protection and promotion of the rights
of the child remained a priority for EU enlargement policy, including in the context of accession 
negotiations and the Stabilisation and Association process. The EU issued an assessment on the 
rights of the child for each enlargement country in May 2019 as part of the enlargement package 
country reports. At multilateral level, the EU, together with the Group of Latin American and 
Caribbean Countries (GRULAC), tabled three resolutions on the rights of the child. Two were
presented during the March session of the Human Rights Council &#8211; one concerned the 30th 
anniversary of the UN CRC and the second focused on empowering children with disabilities for 
the enjoyment of their human rights, including through inclusive education. The third resolution, 
presented at the UN General Assembly Third Committee, covered children without parental care.
The revised EU guidelines underline the importance of developing quality alternative care for
children and providing them with appropriate support to participate in community life and to access 
mainstream services. Under the Call for proposals on quality alternative care for children and
deinstitutionalisation (EUR 13 million) aiming to support initiatives to provide quality alternative 
care, five projects began their implementation in Armenia, Burundi, Cambodia, Georgia and 
Myanmar/Burma, to enable children to grow up in safe and supportive families and communities or 
family-based alternative care settings. The EU also continued to support projects in enlargement 
and neighbourhood countries to prevent the separation of families, strengthen the systems of quality
alternative care and enhance the social protection system for families and children in vulnerable 
situations.

With the Communication on education in emergencies and protracted crises, the EU continued to 
focus its efforts on bringing out-of-school children, especially those forcibly displaced or those in 
vulnerable situations, back into education. This political commitment went hand in hand with a 
financial one: in 2019, the EU&#8217;s commitment to education in emergencies increased to 10 % of its 
humanitarian budget. In order to guide the implementation of humanitarian education in 
emergencies, the EU published a staff working document on education in emergencies in EU-
funded humanitarian aid operations34 . In December 2019, the EU launched its first-ever e-learning
on its humanitarian Gender-Age Marker. In 2019, the EU allocated nearly EUR 64 million of its 
humanitarian aid budget to child protection activities globally, which included violence prevention 
and response; case management, family tracing and reunification; prevention of recruitment, 
demobilisation, release and reintegration of children associated with armed forces and groups, as 
well as support to unaccompanied and separated children, amongst others.

&#8216;Back to the Future&#8217; &#8211; education for Rami, 11, Layan, 10, Tarek, 8, (fake names) from Syria
Zahra (29) is a mother of three: two boys who, until recently, had never received an education, and 
a girl who had attended barely two years of school. In 2016, Zahra, her husband Ibrahim (37) and 
the children fled Idlib looking for safety in Ansar (south of Lebanon), where they now live in a 
small apartment in the basement of a building. Ibrahim, suffering from cardiovascular diseases, 
struggles to make a sufficient daily wage just to pay for his medical bills.
In June 2018, the family approached the &#8216;Back to the Future&#8217; centre near the village of Aabba, 
seeking educational opportunities for their children, Rami, Layan and Tarek. The three children 
started attending the Basic Literacy and Numeracy Programme. At the beginning, Rami had 
difficulties focusing in class, while Tarek would barely speak with classmates or teachers. Layan 
was very bright from the start and made many new friends. Their parents participated in
awarenessraising activities at the centre on the importance of education, the risks of child labour and positive 
parenting. After completing their courses, the children were referred to the Accelerated Learning
Programme, and in October 2019, Rami and Tarek registered in grade 2 and Layan in grade 4 at the 
Ansar Elementary Public School. 
&#8216;Back to the Future&#8217; has provided educational support for 21 700 local and refugee children, as well 
as rehabilitating 23 public schools across Lebanon and Jordan. The project is funded by the EU
Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis, the &#8216;Madad Fund&#8217;, and is run by AVSI
Middle East, War Child Holland and Terre des Hommes Italia.

In September, the EU endorsed the list of priority countries in the area of children and armed 
conflict. This political engagement was supported by concrete projects aiming at prevention of the 
recruitment and use of children in armed conflict; registration and restoration of civil
documentation; family identification, release and reintegration; as well as psycho-social support for 
children affected by armed conflict. The EU also supported the Act to protect campaign35: a global 
advocacy campaign launched by the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on 
Children and Armed Conflict that aims to generate more support and action to protect children 
affected by war and ultimately to end and prevent the six grave violations36. The campaign was 
launched both in New York and in Brussels in the presence of EU officials. The EU, along with the 
delegations from 80 States as well as UN and civil society representatives, participated in the Third 
International Conference on Safe Schools held on 27-29 May in Spain, to discuss cooperation in 
implementing the Safe Schools Declaration and exchange on the solutions to improve the protection
of education in situations of armed conflict.37

Endorsement of the Safe School Declaration in Ukraine
On 26 November 2019, Ukraine became the 100th country to endorse the Safe School 
Declaration. The Safe Schools Declaration is a political commitment to enhance the protection of 
children, teachers and schools and to support the continuation of education during conflict. The 
EU encouraged Ukraine to join the Declaration, including during the EU-Ukraine human rights 
dialogue on 21 March 2019. The EU has also been supporting the advocacy work of UN agencies 
and non-governmental organisations for the effective implementation of the endorsed
Declaration. 
The endorsement by Ukraine represents a milestone in ensuring safe, continuous access to
education for schoolchildren in the conflicted affected areas of Ukraine. The Ukrainian 
authorities are currently preparing an action plan to ensure that the main commitments are
translated efficiently into education sector plans and policies. 
Since the beginning of the conflict in 2014, over 750 education facilities have been damaged and 
many more experienced disruptions to education. Over 400,000 children experience the direct 
impact of the conflict as they live, play and go to school within the 20-km on both sides of the 
&#8216;contact line&#8217;, where shelling, shooting and extreme levels of mine contamination threaten their 
lives and well-being.
In 2019, the EU continued its efforts to eliminate and prevent all forms of violence against children
(including bullying online and offline). This translated into EU support for a global programme to 
accelerate action to end child, early and forced marriage (EUR 6.4 million), a joint programme on 
eliminating female genital mutilation (EUR 11 million) and a global programme to prevent son 
preference and gender-biased sex selection (EUR 2 million). The programme addressing child, early
and forced marriage reached millions of girls in 12 countries in Africa and Asia and focused on 
advocacy, strengthening national protection systems, developing capacities and mobilising
complementary funding.

The Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty, commissioned by the UN Secretary-General in
2016 and co-funded by the EU, was officially launched in November 2019, providing
recommendations for law, policy and practice to safeguard the human rights of children deprived of 
liberty. The EU is also actively working to support efforts to safeguard children in sport: a mapping
study38 on best practices at national and international level was published in 2019. 
In October 2019, the EU adopted Council conclusions on combating the sexual abuse of children39 . 
These conclusions reiterate the commitment to fight against the sexual abuse of children as well as 
to improve prevention, protect victims better and investigate crimes more effectively. The 
conclusions express support for the We Protect Global Alliance to End Child Sexual Exploitation 
Online: a global, multi-stakeholder organisation bringing together governments, law enforcement 
authorities, juridical authorities, industry and civil society to improve the effectiveness of the fight 
against these crimes. The Stop Child Abuse &#8211; Trace an Object40 initiative, which uses tip-offs by
law enforcement authorities and the public to discover the origins of objects relating to the sexual 
abuse of a child, won an award from the European Ombudsman for excellence in 
innovation/transformation in June 2019. Ten children were identified and three offenders 
prosecuted as a result of the tip-offs from the public and law enforcement authorities. Progress was 
made on awareness-raising at global level through the Safer Internet Day and the 
#SaferInternet4EU campaign.  
The EU also continued to implement the key actions set out in the 2017 Commission 
Communication on the protection of children in migration41 in order to protect their rights to 
education, health-care and social protection along the entire migratory route. The EU has launched 
three joint programmes targeting children on the move: Protecting children affected by migration in
Southeast, South, and Central Asia; Support to Afghan refugee children in Afghanistan and Iran; 
and Building Rohingya refugee and host community resilience in Cox&#8217;s Bazar in Bangladesh. To 
better coordinate the different external actions undertaken to reinforce the protection of children in 
countries of origin and transit, the EU and UNICEF held a high-level informal dialogue in March.

The EU approach to addressing trafficking in human beings is child-sensitive. The EU has aligned 
its development cooperation with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs, 
including specifically on child trafficking.42 The crime remains characterised by impunity, both in 
the EU and globally, with the level of prosecutions and convictions of all perpetrators remaining
worryingly low. The EU supports several initiatives aimed at improving the partner countries&#8217; 
criminal justice systems to fight this serious and organised crime. For example, in West Africa, the 
EU works at regional level to improve the protection of people in vulnerable situations, including
victims of trafficking in human beings, by strengthening the cooperation between countries of 
origin, transit and destination, in identification, protection and assistance, and in the prosecution of
criminal networks.

The subject of child labour was raised in political dialogues with candidate and potential candidate 
countries and monitored in the EU enlargement country reports. In 2019, to mark the World Day
against Child Labour, and jointly with the ILO and FAO, the EU organised the event United to End 
Child Labour in Agriculture, gathering representatives of civil society and the private sector43. The 
outcome of the discussion was a set of recommendations44 for the EU and partners to tackle the 
high prevalence of children working in agriculture. In 2019, the EU and its Member States spoke up 
against violations of ILO conventions on child labour in Ethiopia, Iraq and Lao PDR at the 108th 
session of the International Labour Conference. Under the CLEAR Cotton45 project to eliminate 
child and forced labour in the cotton, textile and garment value chains in Burkina Faso, Mali, 
Pakistan and Peru, ongoing activities included training for labour inspectors and research to map 
and analyse the cotton, textile and garment value chains in order to develop adequate and integrated 
strategies to eradicate child labour in the targeted value chains. In cocoa production in West Africa, 
as a key sector with a high prevalence of child labour in particular for exports to the EU, options to 
tackle child labour and ensure decent living wages are being explored and analysed along with 
sustainable production and deforestation challenges. In the framework of a GSP+ mission, the EU 
had the opportunity to examine the progress made in Bolivia regarding child labour, in particular in 
the sugar cane sector, including through corporate social responsibility initiatives. Certification is 
given to products whose value chain production is free of discrimination, forced labour and child 
labour. The scheme is a positive step in improving labour conditions and fostering corporate social 
responsibility in the sector. During the mission, the Bolivian authorities confirmed that following a 
Constitutional Court ruling the Parliament had modified the Child and Adolescent Code to
reestablish the minimum age at 14 and make it compliant with ILO Convention 138 on the Minimum 
Age for Work.

Youth 
In 2019, the EU continued implementing the EU Youth Strategy 2019-202746, which affirms that 
European youth policy and all actions undertaken under the strategy should be firmly anchored in 
the international system of human rights. As a follow-up to two of the four main deliverables 
defined at the EU Conference on Youth, Peace and Security hosted by HR/VP Mogherini in May
2018 &#8212; (i) to continue to create open spaces for young people to come together, build long-term 
relationships and directly engage with the EU; and (ii) to expand the EU communities of young
peacebuilders by including young people from Asia and Latin America &#8212; a new project to 
showcase how the EU engages with young people globally was launched on the European Youth 
Portal.47 This project aims to diversify the content and reach of the Portal through stories and 
opportunities from the global dimension of EU youth engagement. It also contributes to 
implementing the Council conclusions &#8216;EU action to strengthen rules-based multilateralism&#8217;48 of 
June 2019, which call for efforts on public diplomacy on multilateralism to be stepped up.
The EU continued to support meaningful youth participation including through projects such as the 
&#8216;Voices of the Sahel&#8217;. The project has so far contributed to a structured dialogue between youth of 
the Sahel and their authorities, facilitating the creation of local, national and regional dialogue 
mechanisms around five thematic areas: education and vocational education and training, economic 
opportunities, citizen participation and peace and security (including migration and radicalisation).

Establishing the first Human Rights Centre at the National University of Timor-Leste 
In 2019, the EU entrusted the Global Campus of Human Rights, the world&#8217;s largest network of
universities offering postgraduate training on human rights, to lead a new capacity-building
project: &#8216;Development of Human Rights Education and Research at the National University of 
Timor-Leste&#8217;. The 23-month project, financed through the EIDHR and implemented in close 
coordination with the EU delegation in Dili, aims to contribute to the promotion of human rights, 
democracy and development in Timor-Leste through the establishment of a Human Rights Centre
within the Faculty of Social Sciences of the National University.
The creation of the first Human Rights Centre follows the recommendations of the Post-Conflict 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, advocating for the development of human rights curricula 
and resources. The Centre will engage in training, research activities and international 
networking, and is envisaged to become a partner, within the Global Campus Asia-Pacific 
regional hub, of universities in neighbouring and ASEAN countries. Participants in the project 
will lead the mainstreaming of human rights courses in the university curriculum from 2021, 
thereby contributing to a more just and equitable Timor-Leste. 
Moreover, the Centre is growing as a lively hub of learning. Attendees have discussed some of 
the most pressing local human rights causes thanks to weekly public events involving hundreds of 
young people, and thanks also to several outreach activities with local CSOs and key national and 
international stakeholders, such as the Office of the Ombudsperson for Human Rights and the UN 
System in Timor-Leste.

Older Persons
The United Nations&#8217; World Population Prospects 2019 confirmed that in 2018, for the first time in 
history, persons aged 65 or above outnumbered children under five years of age. The number of
persons aged 80 years or over is projected to triple, from 143 million in 2019 to 426 million in 
2050. Europe, with a median age of 45, surpasses the world median age of 33 by 12 years. The shift 
in demographics is positively reflected by enhanced global attention for the needs and rights of 
older persons. 
In October 2019, the EU co-organised the fourth ASEM Conference on Global Ageing and Human 
Rights of Older Persons together with the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions 
and the National Human Rights Commission of the Republic of Korea. The conference focused on 
older persons&#8217; right to work as a key element of their economic, social and cultural rights. Topics 
on the programme included: anti-discrimination of older workers; lifelong education and up-skilling
and re-skilling of workers; and the shift in the job market in the age of the fourth industrial 
revolution. Furthermore, separate sessions were dedicated to the topic of intergenerational solidarity
with the aim of finding solutions to the problem of hate and discrimination against older persons. 
From 25-26 November 2019, the EU took part in the African Regional High-Level Conference on 
the situation of the Human Rights of Older Persons. The Conference brought together the UN and 
the AU as well as the Network of African National Human Rights Institutions and the Economic 
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Parliament. The conference noted that the number 
of older persons in Africa between 2017 and 2050 is expected to grow, with a projected 229 per 
cent increase, from 69 million to 226 million, a cause for celebration that is the result of improved 
healthcare and nutrition, better education and stronger economies.
The conference declaration and call for action underlined that the SDGs would not be achieved on 
the continent unless legal, development and humanitarian strategies took direct action to enhance 
the enjoyment of the social, economic, cultural and political rights by older persons.

The EU also continued to participate in the UN Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Ageing. 
At the OEWG held on 15-19 April 2019, the EU contributed actively to the discussions on &#8216;Social 
protection and social security including social protection floors&#8217;, and &#8216;Education, training, lifelong
learning and capacity building&#8217;. The EU also provided relevant publicly-available factual 
information (including information from the European Institute for Gender Equality -EIGE- and the
EU Fundamental Rights Agency -FRA-) on the situation of older persons in the EU and engaged in 
the exchange of data and best practices.
During the 41st session of the HRC in June 2019, the EU made a statement in the panel &#8216;Technical 
cooperation and capacity-building in the field of the human rights of older persons and their 
autonomy and independence&#8217;. The EU welcomed the shift to a rights-based approach to ageing, 
drawing attention to the 1991 UN Principles for Older Persons and the precarious situation 
concerning social security and health benefits of older persons, and women in particular, who have 
worked in the informal economy.
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) Persons 
Many LGBTI persons around the globe continued to be targets of discrimination, violence and hate
crime in 2019. LGBTI-phobic violence undermines human rights. States have an obligation to 
exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, punish and redress deprivation of life and other acts 
of violence. Failure to do so is a breach of states&#8217; obligations to respect and protect everyone&#8217;s right
to life, liberty and security of person as guaranteed by Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and Articles 6 and 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

The EU is not afraid to speak out against discrimination and encourages states to take all necessary
steps, in particular legislative or administrative measures, to ensure that sexual orientation and 
gender identity may under no circumstances be the basis for criminal penalties. One example is the 
speech by HR/VP Mogherini at the European Parliament emergency debate on Brunei on 18 April: 
&#8216;We believe there is no justification for this kind of punishments. No crime justifies amputation or 
torture, let alone the death penalty. And no person should be punished for loving someone. That can
never be interpreted as a crime&#8217;.
During 2019, the EU continued to address discrimination and violence against LGBTI persons 
through a combination of political and human rights dialogues, awareness-raising activities, 
financial assistance and specific policy tools. More specifically, the human rights of LGBTI persons
were discussed in 25 human rights dialogues with partner countries. In addition, the EU engaged in
public and quiet diplomacy in countries where the human rights of LGBTI persons were under 
attack. In a statement issued in November 2019, the HR/VP&#8217;s spokesperson called for the release of
five men in Malaysia sentenced to caning and imprisonment for engaging in same-sex relations.  
A declaration by the HR/VP on behalf of the EU was issued on the International Day against 
Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia on 17 May 2019. To mark this important occasion, 45 EU 
delegations around the world raised the rainbow flag to draw the attention of policymakers, opinion 
leaders, social movements, the general public and the media to the EU&#8217;s commitment to protecting
the human rights of LGBTI persons. 
Regarding EU enlargement policy, non-discrimination, including on the grounds of sexual 
orientation and gender identity, is a priority for the EU, including in the context of accession 
negotiations and the Stabilisation and Association process. The Commission issued its latest 
assessment on the rights of LGBTI persons in each enlargement country in May 2019 as part of the 
enlargement package country reports.

In 2019, the EU continued to promote stronger partnerships with local and international 
organisations working on the human rights of LGBTI persons, e.g. by hosting debates/seminars on 
relevant issues including discrimination against LGBTI persons, and by endorsing cultural events, 
conferences, or social projects. For instance, during the High-level Conference on &#8216;Advancing
LGBTI equality in the EU: from 2020 and beyond&#8217; on 24-25 September 2019, there was a dedicated 
session on LGBTI human rights in enlargement, neighbourhood and third countries. In the margins 
of this conference, a joint European Commission-World Bank roundtable was held to strengthen 
LGBTI inclusion in the Western Balkans. This meeting brought together government 
representatives from Kosovo, Montenegro, the Republic of North Macedonia and the Republic of 
Serbia, as well as LGBTI civil society organisations from the region and other development 
partners. The EU also provided support to the regional conference organised by the LGBTI Equal 
Rights Association for Western Balkans and Turkey on 7-9 November in the Republic of Albania. 
In the Southern Neighbourhood, the EU continued to support regional activities to protect and 
promote the human rights of LGBTI persons in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, 
including by holding a regional conference on 27-29 September 2019, gathering activists, civil 
society organisations and donor representatives.
The EU contributed to the organisation of a multi-stakeholder exchange on 24-25 October 2019, on 
issues such as legislation, anti-discrimination and curriculum reform in the EU and Asia. The main 
objective was to strengthen Asian and Asia-EU networking to promote the enjoyment of all human 
rights by LGBTI persons.

The EU also continued to promote the principles of equality and non-discrimination in UN fora, by
consistently and constructively engaging with UN mandates focusing on violence and 
discrimination against LGBTI persons, and supporting the UN&#8217;s work in this regard. In line with 
EU LGBTI guidelines and EU Council conclusions on LGBTI equality, the EU reiterated its 
commitment to equality and non-discrimination and to the entitlement of all persons, whatever their
sexual orientation or gender identity, to enjoy the full range of human rights. The EU will continue 
its efforts to enable UN mandate-holders, including the Independent Expert on sexual orientation 
and gender identity, to have access to a range of countries, and to foster a climate of dialogue to 
help overcome fear and suspicion. In September 2019, the EUSR for Human Rights attended the 
UN conference in New York on ending hate speech against LGBTI people in social and traditional 
media. During the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) in March the EU delegation in New 
York organised a side-event on transgender equality.
Within the OSCE, the EU made a statement in the Permanent Council marking the International 
Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia. The EU continued to follow closely the 
situation of LGBTI persons in the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation and raised it in 
statements at the OSCE Permanent Council and the OSCE Human Dimension Implementation 
Meeting, which took place in September 2019 in Warsaw. This issue was also addressed in the 
report under the OSCE Moscow mechanism. In all EU statements and interventions pertaining to 
the general topic of combating intolerance and discrimination, the EU insisted on a comprehensive 
and inclusive approach aiming to address all forms of intolerance and discrimination.

During 2019, the EU remained one of the top five donors worldwide in terms of support given to 
LGBTI civil society organisations. In 2019, the EU contracted EUR 10 million in projects to 
support human rights defenders worldwide working on the promotion and protection of human 
rights of LGBTI persons, with specific actions in Southern Africa (Eswatini, Malawi, Zimbabwe), 
Central America (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua), South America (Bolivia, 
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru) and Russia. These included: supporting preventive security and 
protection from threats; building the capacities of organisations, supporting local initiatives and 
grassroots and nascent movements and encouraging the creation of alliances and networks; 
strengthening advocacy work at all levels, including on legislative and policy reforms and 
awareness-raising; and supporting strategic litigation, reporting and documentation on cases of 
discrimination.

The &#8216;One Community, Many Voices&#8217; Project: a rights-based LGBTI campaign in the 
Eastern Caribbean 
The &#8216;One Community, Many Voices&#8217; project is an EU-funded, 27-month, seven-country
initiative of PCI Media, a leader in communications for social change, and United and Strong
Saint Lucia, one of the strongest LGBTI organisations in the Eastern Caribbean.
The programme was developed in response to a perception and attitude study on the local 
LGBTI community and was designed to re-shape the human rights environment for LGBTI
persons in St. Lucia and the Eastern Caribbean by shifting social norms and changing
perceptions, knowledge and attitudes to reduce discrimination, violence and stigma. This is to 
be achieved mainly through the development of two &#8216;edutainment&#8217; media &#8211; a radio drama and a
magazine &#8211; to be piloted in Saint Lucia before being used as a capacity-building tool for
regional partners creating their own communications for development (C4D) programmes in 
Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines.
The iRight radio drama uses a fictional storyline to raise and address various human rights 
issues, including those affecting the LGBTI community. To further enhance community
dialogue, the 15-minute radio drama is followed by a 45-minute panel discussion and a call-in 
programme with a designated host. The panel discussion segment features experts from various 
fields sharing and discussing information considered relevant to the human rights issue(s) raised 
in the drama. The call-in programme allows the public to freely share their own experiences, 
ask questions and/or raise awareness about issues that are considered important to the public. 
The full 21 episodes of the programme aired live on Radio Caribbean International (RCI), and it 
was subsequently rebroadcast on HITZ FM. 
Surveys of listeners confirm that the iRight radio drama was engaging and realistic, that it aptly
described current realities in many households and communities, and that it brought to the fore 
issues that have been part of the fabric of St. Lucian society for decades, such as domestic 
abuse, while also capturing newly emerging issues that have not been discussed openly in the 
public domain, such as LGBTI stigma.

Persons with Disabilities 
The year 2019 marked the adoption on 9 April of the European Accessibility Act49. The Act aims at 
improving the functioning of the EU internal market for certain accessible products and services by
removing barriers created by divergent legislation. It will facilitate the work of businesses and will 
bring benefits for persons with disabilities in the EU. Many of these products and services are 
important in the education and employment area, for example computers, audio-visual services and 
e-books. The Act responds to the accessibility obligations that bind the EU as a party to the UN
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).
Apart from the benefits which the Act brings for persons with disabilities and businesses in Europe, 
it also gives the EU yet another tool for the exchange of best practices and lessons learned in the 
context of its bilateral and multilateral relations in external action, including through the human 
rights dialogues.
In multilateral fora, the EU continued to actively take part in discussions on the rights of persons 
with disabilities. On 5 March, the EU contributed actively to an interactive dialogue with the 
Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Independent Expert on the 
enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism held during the 40th session of the Human 
Rights Council. During that Council&#8217;s annual debate, the EU made a statement on issues related to 
the rehabilitation of persons with disabilities, stressing the importance of the European Accessibility
Act.  
On 26 February, for the first time in the context of the Human Rights Council, the EU together with 
China co-hosted a side-event entitled &#8216;Leave no-one behind: the key role of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities&#8217;. The side-event highlighted the rich opportunities offered by the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as well as the European Consensus on Development in 
progressing in the implementation of the UN CRPD.

In June, on the initiative of Poland the first-ever resolution on protecting persons with disabilities in
armed conflict was unanimously adopted by the UN Security Council (S/RES/2475).As persons 
living with albinism are disproportionately affected by disabilities, the EU renewed its commitment 
to fight for their protection and for their full inclusion in social, economic and political life, as 
stated in the statement by the EU spokesperson on the occasion of the International Albinism 
Awareness Day on 13 June. 
On 13 May, the annual work forum on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities took place gathering the EU focal points, coordination and independent 
mechanisms as well as civil society including disability organisations. Participants discussed 
political participation of persons with disabilities in view of the European Elections, how to claim 
rights under the UNCRPD and the interplay between the UNCRPD and other international 
conventions such as the CEDAW, the Oviedo Convention or the Convention on the International 
Protection of Adults. 
A conference held on 28-29 November 2019 in Brussels marked the annual European Day of 
Persons with Disabilities. The conference, hosted by the European Commission in partnership with 
the European Disability Forum, brought together politicians, high-level experts as well as
selfadvocates on the rights of persons with disabilities. The mainstreaming of rights of persons with 
disabilities in all EU action and awareness-raising of the daily challenges which persons with 
disabilities face dominated the agenda. The conference also offered an opportunity to discuss the 
preliminary findings of the public consultation on the European Disability Strategy 2010-202050 . 
The findings will be important in informing and shaping the renewal of EU disability strategies 
beyond 2020. During the event, the 10th annual Access City award was handed to Warsaw in 
Poland, and second and third price respectively to Castell&#243;n de la Plana in Spain and to Skellefte&#229; in
Sweden.

Given that persons with disabilities are often disproportionately affected by disasters, and in order 
to ensure that their needs are adequately addressed in all EU-funded humanitarian projects, the 
European Commission has launched in 2019 an Operational Guidance entitled &#8216;The Inclusion of 
Persons with Disabilities in EU-funded Humanitarian Aid Operations&#8217;. The objectives of the 
guidance are to foster inclusion of persons with disabilities, including by providing EU staff and 
humanitarian partners with the tools to ensure this in the design, implementation, and monitoring of 
EU-funded humanitarian projects.
Rights of Indigenous Peoples
In line with the EU&#8217;s commitments to UN mechanisms and processes dedicated to indigenous 
issues, the EU contributed to the celebration of the 2019 International Year of Indigenous 
Languages. On the occasion of the International Day of Indigenous Peoples on 9 August, the 
HR/VP issued a declaration on behalf of the EU. It framed the endangering of indigenous languages 
as one of the direct consequences of the continued violation of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to their 
traditional lands, territories, resources and to self-determination as set out in the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). The EU declaration also 
acknowledged that indigenous peoples are disproportionately affected by poverty, climate change
and violence, including gender-based violence.

In 2019, the EU invested in and supported initiatives to highlight the challenges that indigenous 
peoples are facing in the context of sustainable development. Most important has been the 
continued EU support for the Indigenous Navigator, an open-source data collection and mapping 
tool on the enjoyment of rights by indigenous peoples. The Indigenous Navigator builds on 
international human rights instruments, including the UNDRIP as well as relevant SDG targets and 
indicators. It is used by indigenous peoples&#8217; representative bodies and the EU in the UN fora to 
advocate for the worldwide promotion and respect of the rights of indigenous peoples. During the 
annual session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in April 2019, the EU co-hosted a
seminar to present the preliminary findings on indigenous communities from three continents. The 
EU also supported an event at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development held 
under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council in July 2019. In this instance, the 
Indigenous Navigator contributed to the reports and voluntary national reviews at the high-level
political forum, and subsequently to the Sustainable Development Summit held in September at the 
UN General Assembly. 
The challenges confronting indigenous peoples also feature prominently in the EU&#8217;s growing
attention to the nexus between human rights, environment and climate. During the European 
Development Days (EDDs) held in June 2019, the EU organised an event dedicated to the 
strengthening of international solidarity with and support for indigenous peoples and environmental 
human rights defenders. Furthermore, another event at the EDDs on non-discrimination and the 
human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation brought testimonies from indigenous experts 
along with experts on other frequently discriminated groups such as &#8216;Dalits&#8217; (persons affected by
caste discrimination).
The 21st annual EU-NGO Human Rights Forum held under the theme of &#8216;Building a Fair
Environmental Future&#8217; had a specific session dedicated to indigenous peoples. Indigenous experts, 
including the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, along with indigenous 
youth, had prominent speaking roles allowing them to bring forward concerns and possible 
contributions of indigenous peoples to building a fair environmental future.

Rights of Persons Belonging to Minorities 
Although in 2019 the situation of persons belonging to minorities continued to be challenging in 
many places around the world, the situation for the Rohingya communities in Myanmar/Burma and 
Bangladesh stood out as one of the most severe. In 2019, the EU responded to the dire need for
lifesaving assistance for refugees, displaced persons and host communities across Myanmar/Burma&#8217;s 
Northern Rakhine State and the border district of Cox&#8217;s Bazar in Bangladesh with EUR 43 million 
in humanitarian assistance. In the context of the Human Rights Council&#8217;s resolution on the human 
rights situation in Myanmar/Burma, the EU also continued to address the human rights violations 
and abuses, as well as discrimination suffered by persons belonging to minorities and to ensure the 
necessary conditions for the safe, dignified and voluntary return of refugees. In addition, the EU 
continued to call for the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar/Burma to be 
allowed access to the country, and encouraged the Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General to
engage with all stakeholders towards the identification of sustainable solutions to the crisis.
The EU expressed concern through various channels at the continuously worsening human rights 
situation in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and in Tibet. In the statement by the EU 
delegation in China on International Human Rights Day on 10 December, the EU drew attention to 
reports which inter alia point to the mass detention of Uyghurs and other minorities in political &#8216;
reeducation centres&#8217; and the continuing intimidation of citizens by mass surveillance in Xinjiang. It 
also stated that Uyghurs abroad, including in the EU, are being harassed and, in some instances, 
returned to China involuntarily. The EU expressed its readiness to work closely with China, within 
the framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue and multilateral fora, to promote respect for 
the rule of law and human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration.

The protection of national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities is a fundamental principle of 
international human rights law and the EU founding treaties. The rights of persons belonging to 
minorities therefore featured prominently in the human rights dialogues with partner countries, 
especially those that are home to minorities. This allowed mutual exchanges on non-discrimination 
legislation and efforts to counter hate speech and hate crimes and the multiple discrimination 
affecting women belonging to minorities. It also allowed EU delegations to undertake
awarenessraising activities with respect to frequently overlooked groups such as persons affected by
castebased discrimination, people of African descent and Roma. Throughout the year the EU engaged 
actively in the promotion of tolerance and respect for diversity, and the promotion of the rights of 
persons belonging to national minorities in accordance with applicable UN, CoE and OSCE51 norms
and standards. Discussions on the situation and the rights of persons belonging to minorities were
also pursued at multilateral fora such as the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the UN, including by
supporting the mandate-holders and offices pertaining to persons belonging to minorities. At the 
UN, the EU delivered a statement in the interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on 
minority issues on 13 March at the Human Rights Council, as well as on 22 October at the Third 
Committee of the UN General Assembly. At the 12th session of the UN Forum on Minority Issues, 
which took place on 28-29 November, the EU made a statement under the theme &#8216;Education, 
Language and the Human Rights of Minorities&#8217;. The EU also engaged actively at the first European 
Regional Forum on Minority Issues organised by the UN Special Rapporteur on Minority issues, which 
was held in the European Parliament in Brussels on 6-7 May. Through these fora, the EU highlighted 
its policies on inclusive education, the celebration of linguistic diversity and the rights of persons 
belonging to minorities, as pronounced in EU and international law.

Recognition of the Amazigh language in Morocco 
On 10 June 2019, Moroccan lawmakers unanimously approved a law operationalising the official 
status of the Amazigh language, an important step for the rights of persons belonging to 
minorities, including cultural rights, and the preservation of intangible heritage in Morocco. 
Roughly one third of Morocco&#8217;s population commonly speaks one of the three dialects that make 
up the Amazigh language, also known as Berber. Amazigh was recognised as an official language
and granted the same status as Arabic in the 2011 Moroccan Constitution. The law adopted in 
June 2019 furthers the integration of the Amazigh language in the Moroccan education system 
and public life. 
In particular, the new law aims to extend the use of Amazigh by state and local authorities, as 
well as in public services and the education system. One of the most visible consequences of
Amazigh&#8217;s new status has been the appearance of the Tifinagh alphabet, used to write Amazigh, 
on public buildings and official signs, alongside Arabic and French. The EU has encouraged the 
promotion of Amazigh and language rights in Morocco, in particular by including Amazigh as 
one of the languages used in the audio-visual material posted on social networks by the EU 
delegation in Rabat.

Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance
In March 2019, the Council adopted the EU Human Rights Guidelines on Non-discrimination in 
External Action52. The scope of the guidelines is broad and covers all prohibited grounds for
discrimination. Nevertheless, the guidelines&#8217; conceptual and operational guidance for EU 
institutions and officials and Member States is directly applicable in the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. They feature concepts which are often used in 
the analysis and description of racism and racial discrimination, such as, inter alia, de jure and de
facto discrimination, direct and indirect discrimination, structural discrimination, discriminatory
profiling and multiple discrimination. 
The guidelines also clearly underline that the use and interpretation of the term &#8216;race&#8217; does not 
imply the acceptance of theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races.
In addition, in March 2019 the Commission published a staff working document53 entitled 
&#8216;Countering racism and xenophobia in the EU &#8211; Fostering a society where pluralism, tolerance and 
non-discrimination prevail&#8217;. 
The staff working document describes the reinforced past and current actions to address the 
challenges that the EU is facing in the area of racism, xenophobia and related intolerance. It goes on 
to provide an overview of the progress achieved, including as regards creating a strong legal 
framework and through the undertaking of a comprehensive policy review approach to foster 
equality and non-discrimination. Some areas that merit particular attention in the near future are
also identified, including with respect to particular groups or communities such as people of African 
descent, Jewish and Muslim communities and the Roma. The comprehensive overview of the 
political, legal and factual situation within the EU, combined with the guidance provided by the EU 
Guidelines on Non-discrimination, have been utilised extensively in the EU&#8217;s bilateral and 
multilateral engagements.

In 2019, the EU called for the universal ratification and effective implementation of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) both 
in bilateral dialogues with partner countries and at the UN, such as in the UN Human Rights 
Council, the UN General Assembly Third Committee, and in the follow-up mechanisms dedicated 
to the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
12. ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS
In line with objective 17 in the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy, the EU delivered 
on a comprehensive agenda to promote economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR) in 2019. This 
was done through a three-pronged approach: (i) by increasing the focus on economic, social and 
cultural rights in external action; (ii) by developing operational and political guidance on economic, 
social and cultural rights for the EU and its Member States operating in third countries; and (iii) by
stepping up efforts to protect human rights defenders who are working to uphold economic, social 
and cultural rights including in the context of climate change.
The EU leaders have placed climate change at the top of the EU agenda. The discussions at the 
annual EU-NGO Human Rights Forum in Brussels, focusing on the link between the environment 
and human rights, contributed to shaping the EU&#8217;s external policy under the new Green Deal. 
At the multilateral level, the EU and its Member States have continuously supported resolutions 
under item 3 (Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights, including the right to development) at the Human Rights Council and at the Third 
Committee of the UNGA. Those include the annual resolution on human rights and the 
environment, the resolution on human rights and climate change, and the resolutions on human 
rights defenders and environmental human rights defenders.

In 2019, EU Member States successfully led the way on the adoption of a considerable 
number of initiatives on economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR) at the UNGA and 
HRC, as in previous years, including resolutions on: 
 the right to education (sponsored by Portugal); 
 adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and the 
right to non-discrimination in this context (co-sponsored by Brazil, Finland, Germany
and Namibia); 
 the right to work (co-sponsored by Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Mexico and Romania); 
 the question of the realisation in all countries of economic, social and cultural rights 
(sponsored by Portugal); 
 human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation (co-sponsored by Germany and 
Spain); 
 cultural rights and the protection of cultural heritage (co-sponsored by Argentina, 
Cyprus, Ethiopia, Greece, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Mali, Poland, the Republic of Serbia and 
Switzerland); 
 mental health and human rights (co-sponsored by Brazil and Portugal); 
 rights to social security (co-sponsored by Finland, Iceland, Namibia and South Africa).
Furthermore, the EU continued to support and defend the integrity and independence of the 
mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and her Office, including on thematic 
engagements and support to the Human Rights Council&#8217;s Special Procedures. The EU supported 
and cooperated with several UN Special Rapporteurs working on ESCR, including the Special 
Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, the Special Rapporteur on 
food, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on 
human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable 
environment, the Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally
sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, and the Special Rapporteur on 
the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health.

In 2019, the EU further contributed to the EU-led Good Human Rights Stories Initiative. The EU 
story this year related to the EU&#8217;s new Work-Life Balance Directive54, through which existing
rights for working parents and carers are extended to allow a better distribution of caring
responsibilities within families. Cross-fertilisation of these best practices is an essential addition to 
the important but challenging work of the UN human rights system. A website55 dedicated to the 
initiative was launched including information about past and future events, as well as all videos and 
feature stories shared by the coalition members.
Another part of EU public diplomacy at multilateral level was the speech at the High-Level Political 
Forum on Sustainable Development that took place in July in New York. There, the EU linked 
human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation to climate change and its effect on communities 
in vulnerable situations. The EU used this opportunity to raise awareness of the two sets of human 
rights guidelines adopted by the Council of the EU in June 2019: one on safe drinking water and 
sanitation and the other on non-discrimination. 
The EU Human Rights Guidelines on Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation are a breakthrough in our
work to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights to an adequate standard of living. The guidelines 
are the first ever on economic, social and cultural rights. They underline the EU&#8217;s commitment to 
help realise the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation worldwide, and define priorities for EU 
external action. These guidelines are one of the many steps that the EU is taking towards the 
progressive realisation of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 to &#8216;ensure availability and 
sustainable management of water and sanitation for all&#8217; and SDG 13 on &#8216;taking urgent action to 
combat climate change and its impact&#8217;. These guidelines outline that the human right to safe 
drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, 
acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use; the human 
right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access 
to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable 
and that provides privacy and ensures dignity. With the adoption of these new guidelines, the 
human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation have been mainstreamed into EU foreign policy
and action.

In December 2019, the EU organised a training seminar on human rights guidelines, allowing the 
EU delegations to integrate the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation into their work at
political and operational levels, as well as in the ESCR chapter of their human rights and democracy
country strategies and reports. 
Improving access to safe water and sanitation services for host communities and refugees in
one of the poorest regions in Eastern Sudan
The EU trust fund for the Horn of Africa supports access to water and sanitation services in one 
of the poorest regions in Eastern Sudan. 90 000 refugees are living in nine refugee camps and in 
local communities. Almost all of them are young Eritreans and approximately one thousand 
Eritreans arrive every month. The current facilities are insufficient to meet basic needs of the 
refugee population, as well as the growing numbers of new arrivals. This project worth EUR 2 
million over three years ended in 2019 and contributed to the rehabilitation and construction of 
water sources for human and agricultural use, supported waste management and disposal, and 
provided latrines in school and health facilities both in the camps and in the nearby villages. The 
project also improved the capacity of the Ministries and local administration responsible to 
administer and maintain the new facilities and water systems. In addition, the project has 
promoted safe hygiene and sanitation practise in the communities. This project has improved the
living conditions for approximately 5 million beneficiaries, 11 000 students and 400 teachers in 
26 schools, in addition to 2 health centres and a hospital. 
&#8216;In the past, we used to buy water through donkey carriage providers, but it cost us a lot of 
money. Regarding the school, we had problems related to hygiene facilities. Before we had 
nothing, but now we have access to clean water, bathrooms and we live in a better and clean 
environment&#8217;, said Ahmed Abdelkader, teacher at the Dar Alslam School in Kassala.

Moreover, the EU continued to pay increased attention to ESCR in bilateral dialogues with third 
countries. For example, in the human rights dialogue with Cuba in October, the parties addressed 
ESCR and environmental protection issues. In the political dialogue with Eritrea, the issue of
respecting, protecting and fulfilling ESCR was addressed in relation to the recommendations under 
the universal periodic review process, in which Eritrea agreed to address the rights to education, 
health, housing and an adequate standard of living and the right to culture and protection of cultural 
heritage.  
In our development cooperation, ESCR received further support in 2019. The EU sees cultural 
rights as an enabler of both development and social inclusion. The Council conclusions of April 
2019 reiterated the importance of supporting local cultural sectors as drivers of inclusive and 
sustainable development, cultural diversity, innovation and economic resilience and promoted the 
inclusion of culture in cooperation with third countries.  
The EU fully supports SDG 4 and UNESCO&#8217;s work on inclusive culture and education, ensuring
that &#8216;no one is left behind&#8217;, regardless of ethnicity, gender or disability. EU Member States continue 
to be collectively the largest contributor to the regular budget of UNESCO, and the EU and its 
Member States continue to be its largest voluntary donor. Further to this, EU countries have been 
coordinating closely to maintain UNESCO&#8217;s main mechanism for the protection of human rights in 
the field of education, science and culture. The mechanism provides for the examination of cases 
and questions submitted to UNESCO concerning alleged violations in relation to the right to 
education, the right to take part in cultural life, the right to seek, receive and impart information and
the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications.

The EU continued to support and protect human rights defenders (HRDs) at risk, including
environmental HRDs, fighting for these rights to be realised in their own communities, as well as at 
national and global levels. Environmental HRDs promote safe drinking water and sanitation work at 
all steps of the water and sanitation management and supply chain as well as related policies, 
including those protecting natural resources from exploitation or damage. They include people 
working at international and regional level but also people living in remote villages, forests or 
mountains, and indigenous leaders or community members who are defending their traditional lands 
against the damage caused by large-scale projects such as mining. Front Line Defenders&#8217; global 
analysis in 2018 showed that 77 % of human rights defenders killed in 2018 were working on 
environmental rights issues. The EU provided both political and financial support to HRDs at risk. 
EIDHR funding for the EU human rights defenders mechanism, ProtectDefenders.eu (worth 
EUR 20 million for 2015-2019), had supported more than 30 000 HRDs and their families since 
2015 through a combination of short, medium and long-term initiatives. The EU specifically reacted
to the situation of HRDs working on environmental themes: the EIDHR global call for proposals in 
2017 allocated EUR 5 million to projects &#8216;supporting human rights defenders in the area of
landrelated rights, and indigenous peoples, in the context of inter alia &#8216;land grabbing&#8217; and climate 
change&#8217;, thereby improving the situation for hundreds of environmental HRDs around the world.
Through EIDHR funds, the EU contributed to improving monitoring and enhancing implementation 
of key international human rights and labour (ILO) conventions by countries benefiting from the 
GSP+ arrangement under the EU&#8217;s Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP). To this end, the EU 
supported and empowered civil society actors. Using this rights-based approach, the EU provided 
substantial funding in support of labour rights, social policies, the right to health, social protection, 
education, access to food, water and sanitation and an adequate standard of living under various 
geographical instruments, such as the European Development Fund (EDF), the Development 
Cooperation Instrument (DCI), the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), 
and thematic programmes, such as the Food Security Thematic Programme and the Global Public 
Goods and Challenges Programme. For example, the EU cooperated with the ILO to promote 
labour rights in Myanmar/Burma and to promote the work of the Economic and Social Affairs 
Platform in the Western Balkans to enhance the mechanisms for the amicable settlement of labour 
disputes and to strengthen and modernise labour inspection.

13. BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS
In 2019, the EU continued to address respect for human rights by businesses throughout their 
supply chains, to support the activities of human rights defenders, and to facilitate access to remedy.
The EU called on states and on all business enterprises, both multinational and domestic, to 
implement and comply with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) 
and their three pillars: &#8216;the state duty to protect&#8217;; &#8216;the corporate responsibility to respect&#8217; and 
&#8216;access to remedy&#8217;. The EU actively pursued the issue during human rights dialogues with an 
increasing number of third countries, particularly in Latin America and Asia, and with regional 
organisations, such as ASEAN and the AU. By the end of 2019, 16 EU Member States had adopted 
national action plans (NAPs) on business and human rights, constituting a majority of the 24 states 
that had adopted such plans. The EU supported a regional peer learning event on national action 
plans organised by the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in May 2019.
The EU also continued to promote corporate social responsibility (CSR)/responsible business 
conduct (RBC) and business and human rights as part of the wider work on SDG implementation. 
In a reflection paper &#8216;Towards a Sustainable Europe by 2030&#8217; published in January 2019, the 
Commission underlined that, given the growing complexity and globalisation of supply chains, it is 
important to promote the application of high sustainability standards in third countries too. 
In March 2019, the Commission published an overview of progress on CSR, RBC and business and
human rights across all policy areas. 56 Over 200 initiatives relevant to CSR, RBC and business and 
human rights have been implemented since 2011, using a smart mix of voluntary and regulatory
measures.

Listed companies, banks and insurance companies with more than 500 employees are required to 
disclose non-financial information in their management reports pursuant to the EU Non-Financial 
Reporting Directive57. This information includes environmental, social and labour aspects, respect 
for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery issues. The non-financial statement should include 
information on the due diligence processes implemented by the undertaking, and also on &#8216;the 
principal risks linked to the undertaking&#8217;s operations, including, where relevant and proportionate, 
its business relationships, products or services which are likely to cause adverse impacts [&#8230;] and 
how the undertaking manages those risks.&#8217; The Commission is currently undertaking a fitness check 
of the EU framework for corporate reporting, including the Non-Financial Reporting Directive.
The European Parliament and the Council reached a political agreement on a new EU regulation on 
sustainability disclosures in the financial sector in March 2019. This regulation will require certain 
financial market participants to publish on their websites and in pre-contractual documents 
information about their due diligence policies with regard to the adverse impacts on the 
environment and society of their investment decisions.  
The Commission carried out analytical and consultative work during 2019 with relevant 
stakeholders to assess the possible need to require corporate boards to develop and disclose a 
sustainability strategy, including appropriate due diligence throughout the supply chain, and 
measurable sustainability targets. This work also covers issues related to child labour. This study on 
due diligence requirements in the supply chain focused on requirements to identify, prevent, 
mitigate and account for abuses of human rights, environmental damage, including with respect to 
climate. 58 In addition, the Commission is coordinating its reflections on the referred due diligence 
requirements, the ongoing process for the review of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and 
other initiatives launched under the European Green Deal. Public consultations will be carried out 
in 2020, allowing further stakeholder input on these issues.

In November 2019, the European Commission launched Due Diligence Ready!59, an online portal 
that provides businesses with guidance on how to check the sources of the metals and minerals 
entering their supply chains. It will help businesses to ensure that metals and minerals sourcing
respects human rights and thereby to improve transparency and accountability across their value 
chains.
Concerning access to redress mechanisms for victims of abuse, the EU Agency for Fundamental 
Rights (FRA) worked on a follow-up study to its opinion published in April 2017 on &#8216;Improving
access to remedy in the area of business and human rights at the EU level&#8217;.60 FRA has collected, as
proposed by the Commission in August 2017, &#8216;information on judicial and non-judicial mechanisms
in the Member States concerning access to remedy for victims of business-related violations&#8217;. The 
results of the study will be published in 2020. The Commission also started working on the addition 
of a redress information page on the European e-Justice Portal.61 
Development cooperation plays a special role in promoting responsible management of value chains
and compliance with social and environmental standards and human rights in non-EU countries, as 
set out in the Communication &#8216;A stronger role of the private sector in achieving inclusive 
sustainable growth in developing countries&#8217;.62 The EU supported a wide range of projects related to 
CSR/RBC and sustainable production and consumption, involving key actors in developing
countries, including through multi-stakeholder partnerships.

The EU continued to provide support to civil society and social partners in the implementation of 
the UNGPs through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. The EU published 
its annual EIDHR global call for proposals with a dedicated lot on business and human rights 
accounting for EUR 5 million. Its main objective is to support and empower civil society to 
collaborate with business and investment actors in the mitigation, prevention and remediation of 
adverse impacts of business activities on human rights and, where needed, to hold them 
accountable.  
The EU has included commitments to promote CSR/RBC into all its recently-concluded free trade 
agreements, e.g. the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement and the trade section of the 
modernised EU-Mexico Global Agreement. The latter includes a self-standing article on trade and 
responsible management of supply chains (Article 9 of the chapter on trade and sustainable 
development), with commitments from the parties to support the dissemination of relevant 
international instruments such as the UNGPs. This focus on responsible business practices is 
translating into concrete implementation activities. 
Outreach and capacity-building activities in close cooperation with international organisations and 
civil society are at the core of the implementation of CSR/RBC and business and human rights 
principles. The EU has created pilot partnerships with international organisations such as the ILO, 
the OECD and the OHCHR to provide technical support to develop national action plans in nine 
Latin American countries, with a project that started in January 2019. A similar EU project to 
promote responsible supply chains in six of the EU&#8217;s key trading partners in Asia was launched in 
January 2018 in cooperation with the OECD and the ILO. A third project in Asia in partnership 
with UNDP was due to start at the end of 2019. In the context of its cooperation with the ILO and 
the OECD, the EU also enabled national contact points for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises to be trained on labour issues in responsible business conduct (RBC) by the 
International Training Centre in September 2019.

Within the multilateral framework, the EU contributed to the work of the UN Working Group on 
Business and Human Rights and participated actively in the eighth session of the UN Forum on 
Business and Human Rights in November 2019. In the UNGA Third Committee, the EU continued
to engage in interactive dialogue with the Working Group, supporting effective implementation of 
the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The EU and its Member States maintain 
global lead in developing National Action Plans to implement the UNGPs. The EU organised a joint 
session with the CoE on the role of regional organisations in promoting races to the top on business 
and human rights. The EU also participated constructively in the fifth session of the 
Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) on transnational companies and other business 
enterprises with respect to human rights in October 2019, following discussions on a draft legally
binding instrument on the matter. 
The EU and its Member States also supported the OECD&#8217;s horizontal and sectoral work on due 
diligence, including through financial contributions, as well as the ILO Centenary Declaration for 
the Future of Work. In its conclusions of October 2019, the Council of the EU welcomed the ILO 
Centenary Declaration and underlined the importance of responsible management of global supply
chains, including through due diligence with respect to human rights. The EU was involved in 
drafting and supporting the G7 Social Communiqu&#233; and its &#8216;G7 Social&#8217;s Commitments to Promote 
Responsible Business Conduct in Global Supply Chains&#8217;. Such commitments were reflected also in 
the G7 Social Tripartite Declaration, adopted by the G7 Labour and Employment Ministers and the 
international social partners.63 
To ensure constant progress, the EU institutions continued to invest in awareness-raising of their 
staff about the UN Guiding Principles, with training courses and learning material being made
available, in particular for EU delegations.

Ship to Shore Rights Project - Combatting Forced Labour in the Thai Fishing and Seafood 
Industry
Chith &#8216;Jed&#8217; Poth was just 17 when he migrated from Cambodia to work in the Thai fishing
industry in 2007. At the time, serious labour abuses in the Thai fishing industry were ignored or 
missed by the authorities. Those abuses included the withholding of wages and the confiscation 
of passports, classic signs of possible forced labour situations. 
The EU-funded &#8216;Ship to Shore Rights&#8217; project was launched in 2016 with the objective to reduce 
and prevent unacceptable forms of work in Thailand&#8217;s fishing and seafood industries, such as that 
of Jed. In a relatively short period (4 years) and with a limited budget (EUR 4.2 million) the 
project has made a major contribution to improving the work and living conditions of the 370.000 
workers in the Thai fishing and seafood sector, mostly migrant workers originating from 
Cambodia and Myanmar/Burma.
Changes to Thailand&#8217;s legal and regulatory framework have contributed to these positive 
developments. In 2018 Thailand became the first country in Asia to ratify the Protocol of 2014 to 
the ILO Forced Labour Convention (protocol 29) - a human rights instrument - as well as the ILO
Work in Fishing Convention (Convention 188) - the key international labour standard for the 
fishing sector. The Thai Government has also adopted new rules on labour protection and 
welfare, a ban on child labour, identification of seamen, electronic wage payment and increase in 
minimum wage. 
In addition, the enforcement of labour laws has been strongly reinforced through capacity
building of labour inspectors and interpreters. Guidelines and curricula have been developed so 
that they could be used in inspections at port, carried out in fishing vessels and processing
establishments. 
The evidence collected to date shows that the measures adopted are working, with fewer numbers 
of physical violence (2 % of all workers surveyed) and underage workers (less than 1%) and 
higher numbers of written contracts (43%) and of average real monthly wages (from THB 6.483 
in 2013 to THB 9.980). 
Jed says that on his vessel things are much better. &#8216;There has been a great improvement,
especially with the pay being more consistent and much higher. The workload is now better 
scheduled and we have more rest time. In the past, if we were sick or injured, we can only go to 
the hospital if the skipper or vessel owner allows us to. Now my employers care more about our 
health and well-being, and I can visit the hospital using my social insurance.&#8217; said Jed.

14. THE EU HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACH TO CONFLICTS AND CRISES
Integrating Human Rights into Conflict Prevention, Crisis Management and Transitional
Justice 
Through CSDP missions and operations, the EU is engaged in supporting security, justice and 
defence sector reform and capacity building in host countries in fragile situations, where serious 
human rights violations and abuses are part of the legacy of the conflict or continue to take place. 
The EU stresses the role of human rights and the rule of law in all its CSDP engagements. Just as 
the EU&#8217;s CSDP missions and operations are increasingly deployed to complex conflict 
environments, so have human rights become an increasingly important element of those missions 
and operations, which was reflected in the increase in human rights and gender expert positions in 
several missions in 2019.  
EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo &#8211; combating sexual and gender-based violence 
In partnership with the Institute of Forensic Medicine and the Kosovo Police, the EU Rule of 
Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX Kosovo) launched an awareness-raising campaign in 
September 2019, aimed at raising public awareness to increase the reporting of sexual violence
crimes. It highlighted the importance of preserving biological evidence in sexual violence cases, 
to help bring perpetrators to justice. The campaign particularly targeted youth and it was further
advertised during the 16 days of Activism campaign. Under its Monitoring Pillar, the Mission 
also continued its monitoring of gender-based violence cases. This work has served as a basis for
the development of tailored recommendations provided to the Ministry of Justice, the Kosovo 
Police, the Kosovo Prosecutorial Council and the Kosovo Judicial Council, as well as other 
relevant stakeholders.

CSDP missions and operations, in accordance with their mandates, have integrated human rights 
into their activities and actively promote respect, protection and fulfilment of human rights and 
adherence to international humanitarian Law (IHL) as part of their advisory, mentoring and training
responsibilities. Their advisory and mentoring responsibilities include supporting institutional and 
legislative reforms and ensuring that they comply with international human rights obligations; while 
their training programmes include human rights and IHL components, as well as prevention of 
sexual violence and protection of civilians. 
EU military training mission in Mali &#8211; reinforcing trust between Malian society and armed 
forces
EU military training mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) developed practical, gender-sensitive 
scenarios for the application of international human rights and humanitarian law and the 
protection of civilians for the training of the Malian Armed Forces. With the support of a local 
civil society partner institution, EUTM engaged Malian female role players to act as civilian
population in the training scenarios to make the training more effective and to strengthen trust
between the Malian society and the security and defence forces. EUTM Mali also prepared a 
Train-the-Trainer Manual on international human rights and humanitarian law &#8216;Manuel sur les
Droits des Conflits Arm&#233;s et les Droits de l&#8217;Homme &#224; l&#8217;intention du Personnel Formateur des
FAMA&#8217; for the Malian Armed Forces.
In 2019, the EEAS conducted three conflict analyses and prepared the selection of four countries to 
conduct early warning. The design of each conflict analysis and its recommendations includes an 
assessment of the human rights situation in the country and objectives to contribute towards its 
improvement.

In 2019, the EU continued to implement the EU policy framework on transitional justice. Following 
the adoption of the AU policy document on transitional justice at the AU Summit in February 2019,
the topic of transitional justice was discussed during the EU-AU human rights dialogue held on 19 
October 2019. As a concrete deliverable, both organisations agreed to hold a seminar on transitional 
justice to take discussions further at expert level in 2020. Transitional justice developments were
also discussed in other policy dialogues, e.g. with Colombia, The Gambia and Nepal. The expert 
seminar on the situation in South Sudan also had a dedicated session on transitional justice.
The Facility on Justice in Conflict and Transition, financed under the Instrument contributing to 
Stability and Peace (IcSP), was set up in 2019. The Facility provides short-term support and expert 
advice in the areas of transitional justice, constitution building and restoration of justice for the 
population. Through the rapid deployment of its experts to third countries, the Facility has rendered 
strategic and technical advice, helped jump-start short-term projects, facilitated the analysis of 
opportunities to promote transitional justice and identified solutions to remove obstacles, notably in 
Colombia, Venezuela, The Gambia, South Sudan or the Western Balkans. The consortium 
responsible for implementing the Facility comprises the International Institute for Democracy and 
Electoral Assistance (International IDEA) as consortium leader, Conciliation Resources, the 
International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), the Toledo International Center for Peace &#8211;
Colombia (CITpax-Colombia), and the Swiss Peace Foundation.
Transitional justice was integrated into several training courses in 2019. A separate module 
focusing on transitional justice was part of the regular training course on human rights that took 
place in the week of 17 June 2019. A dedicated session on transitional justice challenges was held 
during the FPI days in April 2019. Presentations relating to specific assignments at country level 
were organised by the Facility on Justice in Conflict and Transition for colleagues based in EU 
delegations. During the 2019 European Development Days, the EEAS hosted a discussion and 
screening on transitional justice, in partnership with the ICTJ.

ANNEX RELEX 2 B LIMITE EN

Transitional justice was also included in broader rule of law and justice programmes, such as in The 
Gambia, where the EU supported the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparation Commission, in the 
Central African Republic, where it supported the Special Criminal Court, and in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, where, in line with the principle of complementarity with the ICC, it 
supported the prosecution and adjudication by the national criminal jurisdictions of crimes against 
humanity committed by militia groups in the South Kivu region.
A thematic evaluation was conducted of the support provided under the IcSP during the 2014-2018
period. 
Transitional justice continues to be one of the 10 common aspects of the full conflict cycle as
described in the integrated approach to external conflicts and crises, adopted in January 2018.
The EU supported the resolution on human rights and transitional justice adopted by the UN HRC 
at its 42nd session in September 2019. The EU also supported the various fact-finding and 
investigative mechanisms set-up by the HRC, such as the Independent International Fact-Finding
Mission (FFM) on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Independent Investigative Mechanism 
for Myanmar/Burma, the Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen, the Commission of Inquiry on 
Burundi, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, the 
Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, and the International Team of Experts on the Kasa&#239; 
region.  
The EU continued to raise concerns about the grave human rights situation and prevailing impunity, 
including continuous systematic persecution of Crimean Tatars and persons belonging to Ukrainian 
speaking communities, in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol illegally
annexed by the Russian Federation, as well as about on-going serious human rights violations and
abuses in areas of eastern Ukraine and in Georgian regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali/South 
Ossetia, not controlled by the respective governments. The EU actively engaged in calling those 
exercising effective control to grant unimpeded access for international human rights mechanisms 
to these regions of Ukraine and Georgia.

Accountability and justice for families of missing persons in Syria
Since 2011, more than 100 000 people have been forcibly disappeared or arbitrarily detained 
across Syria. &#8216;Through my work on the ground, I realised that nearly all Syrian families have 
missing people,&#8217; says Syrian human rights lawyer Noura Ghazi. Her husband, Bassel, 
disappeared from prison in 2015 after three years of detention. In late 2017, Noura discovered 
that Bassel had been executed shortly after his disappearance.
Families of missing persons are entitled to truth and justice and deserve accountability. The EU
supports the Syrian families of victims of forced disappearances through the work of the 
International Commission on Missing Persons. 
The EU&#8217;s IcSP funds a programme focusing on Syria, the Middle East and Northern Africa. This 
programme encompasses a wide range of activities, including the collection of personal data from 
families of the missing. This is an important step toward establishing an effective search process. 
Once a peace agreement for Syria is reached, this search process needs to be expanded in order 
for transitional justice to prevail. 
The Brussels III Conference on Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region addressed the 
issue of accountability and transitional justice, hosting the voices of several Syrian civil society
organisations that represent detainees, families of missing persons, victims and survivors. &#8216;I think 
the phrase &#8220;missing persons&#8221; is self-explanatory,&#8217; said Noura Ghazi. &#8216;Forced disappearance is a 
form of loss in itself. You do not know anything about what is happening to the person you love, 
whether they are dead or alive. You cannot mourn the person even if you know that they have 
died, because you haven&#8217;t seen the body.&#8217;

International Criminal Court 
The EU continued its efforts to participate in the global fight to end impunity, to ensure that 
perpetrators of the most serious crimes under international law are held accountable for their actions
and to achieve justice for victims of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. In that 
context, the EU continued to provide support and assistance to the International Criminal Court 
(ICC) and to cooperate with it.64 
The EU also strengthened the mandate of the EUSR for Human Rights in the areas of international 
criminal justice and international humanitarian law, highlighting his role in implementing the 
Union&#8217;s positions and ensuring their coherence and consistency in these areas.
The EU continued to advocate for the universal ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute 
of the International Criminal Court through the various means at its disposal, in particular during its 
human rights dialogues, through global d&#233;marche campaigns and the systematic inclusion of a 
clause in agreements with third countries encouraging the ratification of, or accession to, the 
Statute, and by supporting outreach activities performed by civil society organisations in Europe 
and in partner countries. 
Support for the ICC also continued in multilateral fora such as the UN Security Council (UNSC), 
the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council.  
The EU continued to offer technical assistance to countries that required it for domestic 
implementation of the Rome Statute. One example of this support was the seminar organised by
Parliamentarians for Global Action to discuss the challenges on the path towards ratification of the 
Rome Statute of the ICC and its implementation into Ukrainian Law. 
In accordance with Council Decision 2011/168/CFSP of 21 March 2011 and the 2011 action 
plan on its implementation, as well as in the framework of the implementation of the 
Agreement between the ICC and the EU of 10 April 2006 on cooperation and assistance.

The EU continued to provide financial support to the ICC, aimed at broadening understanding of
the ICC and the Rome Statute amongst key stakeholders, and at building national capacities in 
dealing with crimes under the Rome Statute. The main activities included seminars, events and 
courses aimed at fostering cooperation, sharing expertise and building national capacity; the 
participation of legal professionals from &#8216;situation countries&#8217; in the Court&#8217;s visiting professionals 
programme; and the development of legal tools to assist legal professionals working on core
international crimes.
International Humanitarian Law
The EU remained engaged in promoting compliance with international humanitarian law (IHL) and 
reaffirmed its strong commitment to the protection of civilians in armed conflicts.
The EU continued fostering respect for IHL across the various areas covered in the &#8216;EU Guidelines 
on promoting compliance with International Humanitarian Law&#8217;. In June 2019, the EU published 
the second report on the implementation of the guidelines, which highlights the activities that the 
EU carried out in support of IHL between July 2017 and December 2018.
As a complementary process, in June 2019 a report on the status of implementation of the common 
pledges made at the 32nd session of the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent 
(Geneva, 2015) was also issued. The report provides additional information on the efforts 
undertaken at Member State and EU level in delivering on the said voluntary commitments.
To mark the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, the EU issued Council conclusions on 
humanitarian assistance and international humanitarian law, to reaffirm its strong support for 
respect for IHL and its commitment to strengthen its efforts to disseminate IHL inside and outside 
the EU and to continue to promote the protection of humanitarian and medical workers in conflict 
areas.

The EU supported and contributed to the 33rd International Conference of the Red Cross and Red 
Crescent held in Geneva in December 2019. During this unique event, bringing together states, the 
International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and other relevant actors in the humanitarian 
field, the EU and its Member States delivered a statement and presented a new set of pledges, which 
will contribute to the promotion and dissemination of IHL.
The Union continued to be active as a member or as an observer in a range of international 
organisations and bodies and, in this capacity, frequently expressed its views on matters of IHL. For 
example, the EU participated in open debates of the UN Security Council, such as the one on the 
protection of civilians in armed conflict, where its statement underlined the Union&#8217;s commitment to 
IHL.
The EU also focused in particular on the protection of humanitarian workers. It continued to 
facilitate, inter alia, the negotiation of the UNGA resolution on the safety and security of 
humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel. It also continued to advocate 
for the need to implement or reinforce context-specific measures to enhance the physical safety of 
medical personnel and infrastructure, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2286. 
As a key humanitarian donor, the EU considers that strengthening compliance with IHL is an 
important element to be taken into account when disbursing funds from the EU humanitarian aid 
budget. The EU continued to support the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC), one of the EU&#8217;s most trusted humanitarian partners, and a key partner in upholding respect 
for IHL and humanitarian principles. In 2019, the ICRC received EUR 124,8 million in funding
from the EU&#8217;s humanitarian aid budget. This included advocacy work on IHL and the protection of 
civilians, in order to contribute to a change of behaviour by armed actors towards IHL, to reduce the 
humanitarian consequences of conflicts, and to increase humanitarian access to conflict-affected 
areas.

The EU also supported Geneva Call, an organisation that works to improve the protection of 
civilians in armed conflict and strengthen the respect for IHL by armed non-State actors. The EU
supported its work in a number of contexts such as Iraq, Syria, Yemen, the DRC and Libya on the 
promotion of respect for IHL by all types of armed non-State actors. The EU continued to support 
the Geneva Call in building globally the humanitarian community&#8217;s capacity to negotiate access to 
war zones with non-State armed groups and to promote their compliance with IHL in armed 
conflict. Support was also provided from the EU humanitarian aid budget to relevant activities of 
the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the UN OHCHR. 
One of the priorities of the EU&#8217;s ongoing co-chairmanship of the Good Humanitarian Donorship 
(GHD) initiative has been to focus on donors&#8217; role in promoting and ensuring respect for IHL. The
emphasis has been on identifying and sharing good practice examples of concrete donor actions, 
including collective engagement, aimed at promoting IHL and reacting to IHL violations.
The EU also promoted capacity building on IHL. For example, it organised a workshop for senior 
officials, jointly with the UN, on humanitarian civil-military coordination, IHL and protection of 
civilians, with a specific focus on Mali/Sahel. In January 2019, the EU Military Committee
approved the EU Concept on Effective Civil-Military Coordination in Support of Humanitarian 
Assistance and Disaster Relief65. This concept, drafted by the EU Military Staff in close association 
with the Commission, highlights the key importance of respect for and promotion of IHL.
Counter-terrorism and the Prevention of and Countering Violent Extremism (CT/P-CVE) 
In 2019, the EU remained fully committed to providing continued support to its key partners in this 
area, with due respect for the rule of law, democracy and human rights and the values enshrined in 
the UN Charter and set out in the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy66 .

Through regular CT political dialogues and security dialogues with priority countries, as well as 
through multilateral coordination67, the EU systematically encourages partners&#8217; efforts to strengthen 
their capacity to prevent and respond effectively to radicalisation, violent extremism and terrorism, 
in full respect of human rights, emphasising the need to ensure that prevention of and countering
violent extremism and counter-terrorism policies and measures do not &#8216;negatively affect, limit or 
impact women&#8217;s rights&#8217; and that CT/P-CVE policy should not be a pretext for cracking down on 
human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
In line with the Council conclusions of June 201768, and through targeted political dialogue and 
counter-terrorism partnerships, the EU has strengthened its cooperation with priority partners. 
These include EU partners such as the UN, the USA, Turkey, countries in the Western Balkans, 
North Africa, the Sahel and the Horn of Africa &#8211; but also the Republic of Korea, Russia, Kuwait, 
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, India and Pakistan. In addition, 
the EU has developed cooperation on CT/P-CVE with Central Asian countries. All those dialogues 
have continuously advocated due integration of human rights and rule of law principles into 
counter-terrorism policies, inter alia through the development of an evidence-based criminal justice 
system. Terrorism and violent extremism are multidimensional challenges that require a 
multifaceted response. While engaging with third countries, the EU highlights the importance of 
prevention as the key pillar of any &#8216;whole of government&#8217; counter-terrorism strategy, and 
recommends the development of a national action plan for the prevention of violent extremism in 
accordance with the UN&#8217;s call to accord a greater role to civil society. The EU encourages a 
civilian-led approach to P-CVE through engagement with local communities, including youth, 
women and religious leaders. It seeks to be at the forefront of encouraging its partners to act against 
hate speech, religious intolerance and divisive rhetoric.

The EU and the UN reinforced their cooperation with the signing of the UN-EU Framework on 
Counter-Terrorism in New York on 24 April 2019, at the second UN-EU High-Level Political 
Dialogue on Counter-Terrorism. The framework promotes cooperation on capacity building to 
counter terrorism and to prevent and counter violent extremism in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
The framework identifies areas for UN-EU cooperation and priorities until 2020. The EU is 
committed to multilateral cooperation to address the global threat of terrorism in full compliance 
with the rule of law and international law, including human rights law and international 
humanitarian law.
The EU is an active member of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) and co-chairs, together 
with Egypt, the Capacity Building in the East Africa Region Working Group. The Working Group 
provides a forum for regional exchange and networking, including on best practices for P-CVE. The 
three GCTF-inspired P-CVE institutions (the Hedayah Centre in Abu Dhabi, the Global Community
Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF) in Geneva and the International Institute for Justice in 
Malta), co-funded by the EU and inspired by the Global Counterterrorism Forum, mainstream a 
human rights-based and &#8216;whole of society&#8217; approach in supporting the development of P-CVE 
programmes. Through the Strengthening Resilience to Violent Extremism (STRIVE) global 
programme, the EU works together with the Hedayah Institute and the GCERF to effectively
challenge radicalisation and recruitment to violent extremism at local level, while continuing to 
respect human rights and international law. The Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) of EU 
experts, created to support EU Member States, has also been deployed externally to support, for 
example, the Western Balkans, Turkey and Tunisia with training workshops focusing on specific 
issues such as de-radicalisation in prisons, reintegration and rehabilitation post-prison sentence, as 
well as reintegration of family members and, in particular, children who are not sentenced for
terrorist crimes upon return to their country of origin.

Furthermore, the EEAS manages the network of regional CT/security experts deployed in EU 
delegations in 15 priority countries, some of whom have regional responsibilities such as the EU 
CT/security expert in the Western Balkans. The network also contributes &#8212; via our partners &#8212; by
locally promoting due respect for the rule of law and human rights while undertaking CT/P-CVE 
activities. Several civilian CSDP missions including the EU Capacity Building Mission in Mali 
(EUCAP Sahel Mali) and the EU Advisory Mission in Iraq (EUAM Iraq), support the building of 
local CT/P-CVE capabilities, with due consideration for human rights and rule-of-law principles.
In the field of humanitarian aid, the EU has been increasingly active within various processes in 
order to ensure that counter-terrorism measures do not have any undue effect on humanitarian aid 
activities, and do not limit the space in which humanitarian actors can respond to needs in a 
principled manner. In November 2019, through Council conclusions on humanitarian assistance and
international humanitarian law, the EU undertook to seek to avoid any potential negative impact of 
counter-terrorism on humanitarian action and encouraged the Member States to ensure that 
domestic counter-terrorism measures and restrictive measures are in accordance with international 
humanitarian law.
15. HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGHOUT KEY EU EXTERNAL POLICIES
Mobility, Migrants, Refugees and Asylum Seekers
Protecting and upholding human rights and fundamental freedoms remained at the core of EU 
asylum and migration policies in 2019. The EU continued to protect and promote these rights 
through existing policy and legislative frameworks. The EU continued to work inside and outside 
the EU, in close cooperation with its Member States and partner countries, international partners, 
civil society organisations and local communities to protect the rights of refugees and IDPs, to 
address human rights challenges associated with migrant smuggling and trafficking in human 
beings, and to address the root causes that force people to leave their homes in the first place.

The EU emphasised the need to work with all our partners around the world, including in the 
framework of the United Nations, because migration and forced displacement require global, 
cooperative alliances with countries of origin, transit and destination and international 
organisations. In December 2019, the EU Commissioners for Crisis Management, Janez Lenar&#269;i&#269;, 
for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Oliv&#233;r V&#225;rhelyi, and for International Partnerships, Jutta 
Urpilainen, attended the first ministerial-level Global Refugee Forum. This global event &#8211; with over 
400 delegations of states, the private sector and NGO representatives and over 840 pledges in the 
areas of education, clean energy, jobs and livelihoods, voluntary return and resettlement &#8211; served to 
catalyse whole-of-society approaches to refugee situations, in support of host countries, refugees 
and their host communities. The EU showcased its significant engagement and support to refugee 
situations worldwide between 2016 and 2019, in line with the EU approach to forced displacement, 
including the creation of new tools and instruments, such as the EU Facility for Refugees in Turkey,
the Madad Trust Fund and the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa; the commitment to policy
efforts towards self-reliance and livelihoods; the continuation of the 10% target for education in 
emergencies in humanitarian aid; the significant financial and operational support to Member
States&#8217; protection capacities; the protection of children along the migratory routes, and age, gender 
and disability considerations; the intention to strengthen efforts to green humanitarian and 
development responses and reduce the climate and environmental footprint; and the continuation of 
the EU support to resettlement in 2020, with EU funding to support EU Member States to resettle 
around 30 000 refugees. The EU co-sponsored four of the six priority areas included on the agenda
of the Global Refugee Forum, namely burden and responsibility-sharing; education; jobs and 
livelihoods; and solutions.
In our relations with partner countries, the EU continued to underline the importance of compliance
with international refugee law, respect for human rights law, the protection of the rights of migrant 
workers, upholding international legal standards to address trafficking in human beings, and the 
protection of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees against abuses, including discrimination, 
racism and xenophobia.

Building on past initiatives, the EU&#8217;s policies generated clear results for the promotion and 
protection of migrants&#8217; human rights. The trilateral African Union-European Union-United Nations 
(AU-EU-UN) Task Force created in November 2017 in the margins of the AU-EU Summit in 
Abidjan continued its work to address the situation of migrants and refugees in Libya. Between the 
beginning of 2017 and the end of 2019, through joint efforts with the IOM and UNHCR, and with 
the support of the AU and the African consulates concerned, over 50 000 people were able to return 
home with reintegration support. Around 5 500 persons of concern were evacuated from Libya in 
preparation for their resettlement or other long-term solutions. In 2019, we continued our efforts to 
improve the dire situation of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees stranded in Libya who have 
been exposed to even greater risk following the renewed outbreak of the conflict. This included the 
provision of assistance at disembarkation points, at detention centres when access is possible, and 
support to host communities, as well as promoting alternatives to detention. In addition to the 
Emergency Transit Mechanism (ETM) in Niger, a new ETM was created in Rwanda. As of 7 
November 2019, 189 migrants had been evacuated from Libya to Rwanda. The EU is supporting
the Rwanda ETM with EUR 10.3 million. 
In Libya, the EU aims to enhance the government&#8217;s capacity to contribute to maritime security,
including the ability to coordinate and execute search and rescue operations in line with 
international standards and obligations. This support includes the Seahorse Mediterranean Network 
project, a project to support integrated border and migration management in Libya in the framework
of the EU Trust Fund for Africa, and the training support provided by Operation Sophia. After a
thorough vetting procedure, Operation Sophia trained 555 Libyan coastguards in order to enhance 
their capacity to carry out search and rescue operations at sea. An essential component of the 
training is dedicated to international humanitarian law and human rights, delivered jointly with the 
IOM and UNHCR.

Since migrants en route to Europe continue to undertake dangerous journeys, the EU has 
established concrete operations to help persons in distress at sea. By the end of 2019, EU operations 
had contributed to saving approximately 700 000 lives. The EU&#8217;s operations also allowed us to 
combat human traffickers and smugglers. This was notably the case of Operation Sophia, which 
contributed to the arrests of many suspected smugglers and traffickers and neutralised hundreds of
assets. 
Conflicts, violence, poverty and lack of socio-economic opportunities, environmental degradation, 
climate change and natural and human-made disasters continued to drive people to flee their homes. 
By the end of 2018, the total number of forcibly displaced persons stood at 70.8 million worldwide. 
As a global player, the EU acted to tackle and solve crises through diplomatic and other means. As 
the leading aid donor in the world, we provided humanitarian assistance and support to refugees, 
asylum seekers and internally displaced people in the majority of displacement crises. Our support 
reached those displaced by long-standing conflicts, from Afghanistan and Syria to Colombia to the 
Horn of Africa, while responding to emerging crises, such as the displacement from Venezuela. 
The EU has been at the forefront of the response to the Venezuelan refugee and migration crisis, 
one of the biggest crises in the world, with 4.8 million Venezuelans having left their country by the 
end of 2019. In 2018/2019, the EU had mobilised around EUR 172 million in humanitarian and 
development aid inside and outside Venezuela, including EUR 89 million in humanitarian 
assistance. The majority of EU humanitarian funds have been used inside Venezuela as the 
epicentre of the crisis, but support has also been provided to Venezuelan migrants and refugees, as 
well as to host communities in neighbouring countries. EU support includes emergency shelter, 
medical assistance, child protection, and prevention of child trafficking and sexual abuse. All EU 
activities are coordinated along the humanitarian-development-peace nexus. The EU also provides 
technical assistance to administrations of neighbouring countries on migration management, social 
protection and employment challenges in the region. The EU also supports regional coordination 
efforts and participates in the Quito Process meetings.

On 28-29 October 2019, HR/VP Mogherini, together with UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
Filippo Grandi and IOM Director General Ant&#243;nio Vitorino, co-chaired the international solidarity
conference on the Venezuelan refugee and migrant crisis. The conference was attended by more
than 500 participants from 120 delegations, including the most affected Latin American and 
Caribbean countries, donor countries, EU institutions and Member States, UN agencies, the private
sector, NGOs, civil society organisations and development actors including international financial 
institutions. The event acknowledged that the serious and deteriorating political, human rights and 
socio-economic crisis in Venezuela has produced one of the most severe displacement crises in the 
world. It also recognised the effort made by the host countries, including through the coordinated 
response framed by the Quito process. Finally, it confirmed the need for a substantial funding
increase and expressed support to the creation of the Group of Friends of the Quito process, chaired 
by the EU.
In response to the crisis in Syria, the EU and its Member States allocated over EUR 17.209 billion 
to provide assistance inside Syria and to assist those who fled to neighbouring countries and need 
support to access education and healthcare and meet their basic needs. In an effort to support 
Turkey in hosting 3.7 million Syrian refugees, the Facility for Refugees in Turkey69, set up in 
February 2016 with a total budget of EUR 6 billion for 2016-2019, focused on protection, 
education, health, municipal infrastructure, and socio-economic support. To date, the full budget of 
EUR 6 billion has been allocated.
In 2019, the EU provided EUR 36 million for the Rohingya humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh and 
Myanmar/Burma, in the form of basic services, protection and preparedness for monsoon and 
cyclone-related disasters. From 2017 to 2019, the EU disbursed over EUR 150 million in 
humanitarian and development assistance to respond to the crisis in Bangladesh and 
Myanmar/Burma.

With EU development assistance and stabilisation efforts, the EU supported partner countries to 
improve their capacity to deal with the more long-term and structural root causes of irregular 
migration and forced displacement. The EU Trust Fund for Africa that complements official EU 
development assistance, with a general budget of over EUR 4.7 billion, allowed the EU and its 
Member States to work jointly with African partners faster and with more flexibility, resulting in 
greater efficiency. The projects under the Trust Fund, implemented in the Sahel and Lake Chad, the 
Horn of Africa and the regions in the North of Africa, focused on the creation of jobs and economic 
development; better migration management, including international protection and asylum, legal 
migration and mobility; and enhancing synergies between migration and development.
The external dimension is an integral part of the EU policy framework to address trafficking in 
human beings and is one of its pillars. Trafficking in human beings is a complex phenomenon that 
continues to be systematically addressed in key policy instruments, ranging from security to 
migration, justice, equality, anti-discrimination, fundamental rights, employment, and development. 
The EU policy framework to address trafficking in human beings has an important external 
dimension. As a result, addressing trafficking in human beings is also embedded in many EU 
external policies, agreements, partnerships and dialogues with non-EU countries, such as &#8212;
amongst others &#8212; the Khartoum and Rabat processes. 
New projects have been undertaken in partner countries and regions through the start of the UN 
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)-led regional programmes in North Africa (&#8216;Dismantling the 
criminal networks operating in North Africa and involved in migrant smuggling and human 
trafficking&#8217;) and Asia and the Middle East (&#8216;Global Action against Trafficking in Persons and the 
Smuggling of Migrants - Asia and the Middle East&#8217;). In Niger, a joint investigation team bringing
together Nigerien, French and Spanish authorities has led so far to 288 judicial cases. New projects 
with Senegal and Guinea were developed in 2019 to support these partner countries&#8217; efforts to fight 
trafficking in human beings, and migrant smuggling. Tackling migrant smuggling and enhancing
border management were also key parts of the work of CSDP missions and operations, such as
Operation Sophia (EUNAVFOR Med) and the EU integrated border management assistance 
mission in Libya (EUBAM Libya).

The EU-UN &#8216;Spotlight Initiative&#8217; to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, 
funded by the EU with a budget of EUR 500 million, was launched in 2017 together with its first 
project &#8216;Safe and Fair&#8217;. With financial support of over EUR 25 million, the regional project &#8216;Safe 
and Fair&#8217; contributes to improving labour migration conditions for women in the ASEAN region. 
Together with UN Women and the ILO, the EU works with governments, community-based 
organisations, civil society and service providers to improve labour laws and access to information 
and services, and to prevent and put an end to violence and trafficking of women and girls. Between 
2017 and 2019, Safe and Fair reached more than one million people through its public campaigns, 
provided information to more than 5 000 female migrant workers and their families and trained 
more than 700 people. Safe and Fair&#8217;s work is helping to change the narrative around female 
migrant workers in the ASEAN region, shifting negative perceptions and challenging deep-rooted 
gender stereotypes.
Connecting women migrant workers to a wider movement: Safe and Fair reaches women 
online and amplifies voices 
The Safe and Fair Programme has now reached 1 191 164 people through public campaigns. 
Namwaan (alias), a migrant worker from Myanmar/Burma living in Thailand, initially worked in 
textile manufacturing, where her hours were long and her wages meagre, and she saw her 
colleagues experience violence. Then she saw a video about the Safe and Fair Programme. 
Namwaan felt the video spoke on her behalf and connected her to a wider movement. She made
contact with the Programme and shared her story for the November 2019 Safe and Fair photo 
exhibition &#8216;Extraordinary Women: Journeys out of the Ordinary&#8217;. On 3 December 2019, she took 
her priorities for change to over 100 policy makers, employers and trade unionists at the
interregional meeting &#8216;Labour Mobility between Asia and the Arab States&#8217;. 
&#8216;I am glad that people have not forgotten about us, and there are some people who are working to
protect our rights. Millions of women migrant workers will benefit from Safe and Fair, and there 
will be more and more women with decent work that is free from violence.&#8217;

Trade 
Together with other EU external policies, our trade policy effectively contributes to promoting and 
protecting human rights in third countries, inter alia through the EU&#8217;s GSP, bilateral free trade 
agreements (FTAs) and efforts to promote torture-free trade worldwide.
In 2019, human rights were addressed as a key topic in the context of the unilateral trade 
preferences that the EU provides to developing countries within the GSP. Countries that appeared 
unwilling to address human rights challenges were subject to increased scrutiny. In particular, the 
EU continued with the process of &#8216;enhanced engagement&#8217; with Bangladesh, Myanmar/Burma and 
Cambodia: 
- The EU&#8217;s engagement with Bangladesh focused on compliance with the ILO&#8217;s international 
labour standards. During a monitoring mission in October 2019, Bangladesh agreed to develop a 
roadmap with timelines to improve its labour rights situation, notably through the alignment of the 
Bangladesh Labour Act, the Bangladesh Labour Rules and the Export Processing Zone Act 
Ordinance with the requests of the ILO supervisory mechanism, through combatting violence 
against workers and anti-union discrimination and through taking necessary measures to eliminate 
child labour by 2025. 
- With regard to Myanmar/Burma, concerns over human rights and labour rights were raised during
high-level monitoring missions in February 2019. Discussions continued during the first ever EU-
Myanmar/Burma Senior Officials Meeting in May 2019 and the human rights dialogue co-chaired 
by the EU Special Representative for Human Rights in June 2019. The concerns over labour rights 
refer in particular to forced labour used by the military (Tatmadaw), to child labour and to 
violations of freedom of association.
- Lack of progress on human and labour rights in Cambodia led to the start of a procedure to 
partially withdraw EU trade preferences under the GSP.

In the context of the EU&#8217;s bilateral FTAs (in particular as part of their &#8216;trade and sustainable 
development&#8217; chapters) the year 2019 saw increased efforts to improve the effective implementation 
of the labour rights enshrined in fundamental ILO conventions:
- The EU requested consultations with the government of the Republic of Korea in relation to 
commitments made in the EU-Republic of Korea FTA to (i) respect the ILO core principle of 
freedom of association and (ii) make sustained and continuous efforts to ratify the four fundamental
ILO conventions that Korea had not yet ratified (on forced labour and the freedom of association 
and collective bargaining). In July 2019, the EU requested the establishment of a panel of experts 
under the dispute settlement procedure provided for in the trade and sustainable development 
chapter of the FTA. 
- The EU engaged with Vietnam to promote &#8216;early implementation&#8217; of trade and sustainable 
development commitments under the EU-Vietnam FTA. In 2019, Vietnam ratified one of the 
fundamental ILO conventions (C98 on collective bargaining) that it had not yet ratified and 
provided timelines for the ratification of two others (C87 on freedom of association, in 2023, and 
C105 on forced labour, in 2020). Vietnam also continued internal work on labour reform, most 
notably by introducing a new labour code that allows &#8211; in principle &#8211; independent Workers 
Representative Organisations at enterprise level. The EU will engage with Vietnam to ensure that 
the country is meeting its commitments to take the necessary measures to respect the ILO 
fundamental principles and rights at work, including on freedom of association and to eliminate 
child labour by 2025.
- On issues related to freedom of association, child labour, forced labour and labour informality, the 
EU also continued its dialogue with Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In Colombia, discrimination
against trade unions and violence against trade union leaders was consistently raised as a concern. 
For all three countries, the EU monitored progress in strengthening labour inspections. In January
2019, an EU-financed technical assistance project to improve labour inspection capacity in the rural 
parts of Colombia was launched by the ILO.

- The EU also continued to engage with Central American countries on key labour issues including
child and forced labour, violence against trade unionists, freedom of association and equal pay for
equal work. In Honduras, a tripartite group of employers, workers and civil society developed a 
process for the prevention and eradication of child labour under a national plan of action. In El 
Salvador, the High Labour Council (consisting of representatives of the government, employers, 
and trade unions) was re-established. 
In the same vein, the European Commission started implementing a &#8216;Trade for Decent Work&#8217;
project with the ILO. It provides capacity building and ad hoc support on labour rights and 
promotes corporate social responsibility/responsible business conduct in countries the EU trades 
with. In 2019, the project supported labour-related activities in Bangladesh, Myanmar/Burma, Peru 
and Vietnam and training for EU national contact points on responsible business conduct.
Finally, in the context of the Global Alliance for Torture-Free Trade70 &#8211; which the EU, together
with Argentina and Mongolia, launched in 2017 &#8211; the UN General Assembly adopted an important 
resolution in June 2019 to examine the feasibility and scope of possible international standards 
regarding the import, export and transfer of goods used for torture and the death penalty.
Development Cooperation
Human rights and democracy were key elements of the internal assessments of countries and 
regions that were carried out in preparation for implementing the next multiannual financial 
framework (MFF). These assessments are comprehensive and determine the objectives of the EU&#8217;s 
political, economic and development cooperation, which the EU will seek to attain jointly with the 
Member States.

In its bilateral development cooperation, the EU continued to mainstream its rights-based approach 
to promote human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Thereby, the EU, together with its 
Member States, delivers on its commitment to integrate all human rights, civil and political, as well 
as economic, social and cultural, into development cooperation. This helps the EU to foster the 
principles set out in the treaties, i.e. indivisibility of human rights, respect for human dignity, and 
equality, democracy and the rule of law, and contributes to implementing the 2030 Agenda, in line 
with the new European Consensus on Development, adopted in June 2017, and with the principles 
of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation71 (in particular transparency, 
accountability, inclusive partnerships and local ownership). 
Integrating human rights and democracy in development cooperation and promoting them through a 
rights-based approach also helps build resilient and sustainable societies and reduce the potential for
conflict. This approach is of central importance as it helps to deliver on the EU priority focused on 
conflict prevention contained in the Global Strategy for the European Union&#8217;s Foreign and Security
Policy, adopted in 2016. Experience has shown that one of the keys to preventing societies from 
descending into crisis and violent conflict is to underpin their resilience by ensuring respect for all 
human rights and the rule of law, and by investing in inclusive and sustainable development. 
Thus, in line with Goal 16 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, through its 
development cooperation instruments, the EU also continued to help build strong, transparent and 
accountable institutions, independent and impartial courts, and support the provision of fair justice,
access to legal assistance and initiatives to tackle corruption. These are considered pivotal elements 
to promote human rights, democracy, the rule of law, inclusion, participation, non-discrimination 
and gender equality.

Civil society are indispensable partners in building just, equitable and resilient societies, both as 
implementing partners, as development actors in their own right, and as watchdogs and advocates to
defend human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The EU and its Member States offer 
significant political, financial and technical support to civil society. Efforts include strengthening
the capacities of civil society actors and the enabling environment for their work, pushing back 
against the shrinking space for civil society and supporting HRDs.
In multilateral fora, the EU took on a leading role in support of the 2030 Agenda, including its 
important goals and targets related to democracy and human rights. This was marked at the UN
High-Level Political Forum in July 2019, where the EU presented the state of play of its efforts to 
implement the 2030 Agenda externally as well as internally, based on key documents, including the
EU synthesis report, the Commission reflection paper (&#8216;Towards a Sustainable Europe&#8217;) and the
relevant Council conclusions. The EU&#8217;s leading role was further reflected at the SDG Summit in 
September 2019, where the EU played a key role in shaping the political declaration. The EU led 
the charge for ambition and action, reflecting on the priorities of the next Commission with regard 
to further mainstreaming SDGs in EU external and internal policies. 
In addition, the EU started piloting a process on integrated national financial frameworks in 
cooperation with the UN, the World Bank and the IMF. These frameworks will help mobilise and 
track resources in support of implementing the 2030 Agenda.

16. EU INSTRUMENTS 
Human Rights Guidelines
The EU has adopted 13 sets of guidelines, which set out priority areas for external action. The 
guidelines represent a strong political signal about the Union&#8217;s priorities. The guidelines are 
updated regularly, and serve as a practical tool when implementing EU human rights priorities at 
local level. In the first half of 2019, the Council adopted EU Human Rights Guidelines on Non-
Discrimination in External Action72, as well as EU Human Rights Guidelines on Safe Drinking
Water and Sanitation73 . In the second half of 2019, the Council adopted revised Guidelines on EU 
Policy towards Third Countries on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment.74

Human Rights and Democracy Country Strategies
These strategies are prepared by EU delegations and Member States&#8217; missions, following close 
consultation with relevant interlocutors based on a political and operational analysis of the human 
rights situation in a given country. They identify key strategic priorities for EU action on human 
rights and democracy, define long- and short-term key objectives, and set out concrete actions to 
advance human rights and democracy in a specific country. 128 country strategies covering the 
period 2016-2020 are being implemented. Among these strategies, the rule of law is the most 
frequently identified priority, followed by women&#8217;s rights and democracy. These strategies and 
their annual implementation reports constitute an essential tool in ensuring policy consistency and 
in preparing high-level visits and political dialogues.

Human Rights Dialogues 
Human rights dialogues constitute a key instrument for enabling the EU to engage bilaterally on 
human rights, focusing on themes such as gender equality and women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; full enjoyment of
human rights, the rights of the child, freedom of expression online and offline, torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the death penalty, freedom of religion or 
belief, the rights of persons with disabilities, and the rights of persons belonging to minorities. 
Cooperation in multilateral fora also features prominently in human rights dialogues. Consultations 
with civil society are carried out prior to the human rights dialogues, and briefings are held on the 
outcomes. Dedicated civil society seminars take place back-to-back with many human rights 
dialogues.  
In 2019, the EU held human rights dialogues and consultations with 39 partner countries, and with 
regional groupings. The 15th AU-EU human rights dialogue took place on 19 October 2019 in 
Banjul, The Gambia, in the margins of the 65th ordinary session of the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (ACHPR). The AU and the EU discussed recent developments in 
Africa and Europe in the area of human rights, notably progress made by AU bodies with a human 
rights mandate. Both sides reaffirmed the importance of cross-regional cooperation to promote and 
protect human rights, as well as the importance of mutual learning and exchange of best practices 
based on shared values and mutual interest. The sixth EU-South Africa structured dialogue forum 
on human rights, held in November in Brussels, offered an opportunity to exchange views on a wide
range of human rights and multilateral issues. In focus were issues related to: racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; the promotion of economic, social and cultural 
rights; the fight against torture; women&#8217;s empowerment and gender equality; human rights 
defenders; and business and human rights. Both sides have agreed to explore opportunities for joint 
action in view of the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 2020.

On 4 March 2019, the eighth EU-Vietnam human rights dialogue was held in Brussels, which 
allowed for an open discussion on a wide range of human rights issues related, inter alia, to 
freedom of expression online and offline, cybersecurity, the death penalty, labour rights, the 
environment, and cooperation within the UN framework. 
The fifth EU-Myanmar/Burma human rights dialogue was held in Nay Pyi Taw on 14 June 2019. 
Discussions covered a number of human rights issues, including accountability for human rights 
violations and the situation in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States, including humanitarian access, 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, the needs of displaced persons, economic and social 
rights, migration, and human rights cooperation in multilateral fora.
In November, the eighth EU-Indonesia on human rights dialogue was held in Brussels. Topics of 
mutual interest and concern were addressed, ranging from access to justice to international 
humanitarian law, from the rights of people belonging to minorities/persons in vulnerable situations, 
to freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and cooperation in the UN 
and other multilateral fora. 
The sixth EU-Belarus human rights dialogue was held on 18 June in Brussels, focusing on policy
developments, the implementation of the National Human Rights Action Plan in Belarus and the 
human rights situation in the country. Particular attention was dedicated to the restrictions of the 
freedoms of expression, assembly and association. The participants also reviewed policies on 
gender equality and the fight against violence in the family, and the state of their implementation. 
The EU reiterated its unequivocal opposition to the use of the death penalty at all times and in all 
circumstances.

The eighth EU-Brazil human rights dialogue, held on 9 October in Brussels, offered an opportunity
for a wide-ranging exchange of views on bilateral and multilateral matters, notably strengthening
the human rights of women and girls and of members of the LGBTI community, issues of racism 
and discrimination, the enjoyment of human rights by indigenous peoples, human rights defenders 
and persons with disabilities. 
The fifth high-level political dialogue between Colombia and the EU, held on 15 July in Bogot&#225;, 
included dedicated dialogue mechanisms for human rights. 
In October, the EU hosted the second formal human rights dialogue with Cuba under the EU-Cuba 
Agreement on Political Dialogue and Cooperation.
Informal human rights dialogues with Gulf countries were also held in Brussels, covering issues of 
concern such as the death penalty, the right to fair trial and the freedom of expression.  
A key step towards the dismantling of the kafala (&#8216;sponsorship&#8217;) system in Qatar 
The need to dismantle the kafala (&#8216;sponsorship&#8217;) system has been vigorously advocated by the EU 
in all the informal human rights dialogues with Gulf countries (so far with Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar
and UAE) in recent years. Qatar has been at the forefront of these reforms, making good progress 
towards upgrading its Labour Law and improving the living conditions of the migrant workers. In
2019, Qatar entered its second year of cooperation with the ILO Office in Doha. This led to new 
legislation in January 2020 allowing domestic workers to leave Qatar, either temporarily or
permanently, during their employment contract, if they desire to do so &#8211; meaning that workers who 
are not covered by the Labour Law, mainly domestic staff, no longer need an exit visa. This 
measure constitutes another key step towards the dismantling of the kafala system that governs the 
employment of migrant workers, which has historically given employers extensive control over 
their employees.

Human rights consultations with the United States resumed on 9 December in Brussels, with both 
parties reaffirming their strong commitment to the democratic principles and human rights as laid 
down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The consultations covered a broad 
range of issues including gender equality, women, peace and security, freedom of religion or belief 
including prisoners of conscience, business and human rights, labour rights, trade instruments, and 
human rights defenders. 
In June, the sixth meeting of the EU-Egypt subcommittee took place in Cairo, focusing on bilateral 
and multilateral cooperation in the areas of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and fighting
corruption.  
European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights
In 2019, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) continued to prove 
itself to be a unique financing instrument both at EU level and at international level for promoting
and supporting democracy and human rights worldwide.
Building on its key strengths, the ability to operate without the consent of the host-state government 
and a global reach, the EIDHR continued to focus on sensitive issues and difficult situations, using
innovative approaches and cooperating directly with isolated and marginalised civil society
organisations. In 2019, the EIDHR successfully delivered on its five objectives.

For the first time in 2019, the EIDHR reached its goal of allocating at least 25 % of the funds to 
objective 1 on support to human rights and human rights defenders in situations where they are 
most at risk. This ratio was 15 % more than the previous period (2014-2017). 2019 saw the renewal
for a three-year period of the EU emergency fund for human rights defenders, thereby ensuring ad 
hoc support to human rights defenders at risk in a context of rising threats against them and 
shrinking civic and democratic space in many countries around the globe. A new phase of the 
ProtectDefenders mechanism, lasting three years and with a total budget of EUR 15 million, started 
in November 2019, ensuring uninterrupted support to HRDs. A new phase of the EU Emergency
Fund, also aimed at providing assistance to HRDs, started in December 2019. Both mechanisms 
(ProtectDefenders and the Emergency Fund) will be operational until 2022. Moreover, 12 projects 
were funded in 2019 through the Human Rights Crises Facility, thus supporting human rights in 
countries where the political and legal contexts are most challenging.
Concerning objective 2 of the EIDHR on support for other EU human rights priorities, the 2018 
global call for proposals led to the selection of 11 projects on promoting and protecting the human 
rights of LGBTI persons and on the abolition of the death penalty, for a total of EUR 17 million. 
EU funding also facilitates the global participation of indigenous peoples&#8217; representatives in the UN
human rights fora through support given to the technical secretariat run by the Indigenous Peoples&#8217; 
Centre for Documentation, Research and Information (DOCIP).
The main objective 2 themes selected by EU delegations during 2018-2019 for the implementation 
of the allocations to their host countries were: women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; full enjoyment of human rights; 
combating discrimination; economic, social and cultural rights; the death penalty and torture; rights 
of the child; the environment and human rights; and freedom of religion or belief. The EU continues 
to support the Indigenous Navigator, which is a data collection framework for and by indigenous 
peoples to monitor the level of recognition and implementation of their rights.

Support for democracy features as objective 3 of the EIDHR including support for domestic 
electoral observers, media development projects, projects supporting digitalisation, women and 
youth participation in politics, as well as support for parliaments and accountable institutions. In
2019 alone, new projects and programmes of an overall value of EUR 7 million were initiated in 14 
countries under the EIDHR. Furthermore, the 2019 global call for proposals resulted in the award of 
grants for projects in Brazil, Cambodia and Central Asia on leveraging digital technologies to 
increase democratic participation, for a total of EUR 5.2 million.  
With regard to EU election observation, under objective 4 of the EIDHR, a total of eight electoral 
observation missions, seven election expert missions and seven electoral follow-up missions were
deployed in partner countries in 2019.
Finally, as per objective 5 on support for targeted key actors and processes, the EIDHR was 
confirmed to be a major supporter of multilateralism and the key institutions of the human rights 
architecture worldwide. Throughout 2019, it continued to provide support among others to the 
OHCHR, the ICC, as well as regional human rights mechanisms and instruments. Furthermore, 
EIDHR continued to provide support to a global network of universities for human rights education 
through the Global Campus of Human Rights, with EUR 4.75 million for the academic year 2019-
2020.

Policy Support Facility of the Partnership Instrument
In 2019, under the FPI&#8217;s Policy Support Facility for the Partnership Instrument, the pilot project 
&#8216;Human rights policy support&#8217; was launched with a budget of EUR 1 million for a period of 18 
months. This action reinforces the implementation of international human rights standards and best 
practices by third countries and promotes EU and international shared principles and values.
The project is based on three main objectives: (i) to ensure the appropriate follow-up to political and 
human rights dialogues with partner countries; (ii) to contribute to bringing together expertise from
the EU and partner countries to promote best practices on human rights; and (iii) to support and 
enhance the monitoring of GSP+/EBA beneficiaries&#8217; commitments under the seven GSP core
human rights conventions. 
Under the human rights facility, a two-day event focusing on the promotion of human rights of 
LGBTI persons was organised on 24-25 October in Taipei. The aim of this event was to create a 
network to connect government officials and civil society actors from the region so that they could 
exchange experiences information about their national gender equality policies and EU best 
practices on the promotion of the enjoyment of all human rights by LGTBI persons.
On the International Human Rights Day on 10 December 2019, an event was organised to reflect on 
the rights of the child, non-discrimination and the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation. The 
storytelling experience offered by the event enabled human rights NGOs, third countries&#8217;
diplomatic representations and EU officials to network with one another, and a booklet containing
the 12 EU guidelines on human rights was distributed to highlight the EU&#8217;s strong commitment to 
the promotion of human rights.
